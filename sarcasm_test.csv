0,Ketamine is FDA approved,"This would already be the case if not for the FDA. FDA approval is required to sell new medications in FDA-regulated markets, which is where the big pharm companies make a return on investment. The FDA closely monitors the process and approves where the research, development, clinical trials, and manufacturing can be done. Also part of the reason that companies like Sun Pharm out of India don't bother with their own R&amp;D -- receiving FDA approval for anything they developed on their own would be a significant obstacle. There are plenty of drugs that are commonly used around the world that we rarely use in the USA just because the FDA said nope. Ketamine, for example."
0,You must be good at sex.,"To everyone else who says tubes or commando is unbalanced, try them for a while. I'll go 30-5 with the m16, famas, m4, or p90 and no one will complain. But god forbid I go 22-11 with a tube. Clearly it must be imbalanced. The game is balanced pretty well for the most part. When I started, there were guns I felt were imbalanced. But for each one my opinion changed after I played with them (with possible exception of the Raffica). Everyone whines about everything in this game and it gets annoying. It seems that using a FAL and a throwing knife is the only way to be a non-newb in people's minds. Meanwhile, people are fine with the game becoming a camptastic snipe fest because the fact that you're holding a sniper rifle makes it ok to camp. This game would be impossibly boring without good run and gun set ups and commando is part of it. And every time I see someone get mad at tubing and say ""Fine I'll tube"". They fail miserably and prove the opposite of what they meant to prove. I say, run around and tac knife for a while and compare your tac knife average score to your normal average score and then you can say it's imbalanced. If you're tired of getting commando'd then use the SPAS (it shuts the knifer up really quick) but for the love of god please stop whining in game."

He sought tirelessly to end poverty, to feed and house the needy and to heal those in need, and as Werleman noted on his recent appearance on Ring of Fire, Jesus did all of this without asking for a copay first.* *The Republican claim to be doing any of their work in the name of God, Jesus or Christianity is an outright lie. They are banking on the fact that the majority of their members are clueless about what is inside the Bible and rely on highly conservative church leaders to give churchgoers a skewed and misleading image of Jesus and Christianity.* *The Republican Party has learned to use religion as the sheep-herding tool it was created to be.*"

Being very pleased with the phone I have even recommended it to my friends and one of them bought the phone. As of lately I was eager to see the OPT get a Marshmallow update because I thought there would be some information revealed regarding Android M on OPX, but that didn't happen. Last thing I heard was that there was an issue between OP and Qualcomm regarding the OPX chipset or something. And that was it. OPX has the same CPU as OPO so what seems to be the issue? And there is still a framedrop/lag while playing intensive games so that is still unresolved... Has OnePlus forgotten about us? Is the phone outdated already after only a few minor bugfix updates? OPO users have great custom roms, OPT has Marshmallow, OPX neither yet..."

0,"Haha, no problem it was really interesting.","In short, no.... When I first came here, back when Hu Jintao was in charge, I was really excited about the future for China. People seemed outward looking, forward thinking, open-minded and optimistic... a big contrast to the UK in the first few years under the coalition. Young people especially were very excited about the future, very interested in the world, and many people knew how to get around all the internet restrictions, which was pretty easy at the time. At the same time as this, they were unleashing their massive infrastructure project, and you could visit so many grim, polluted, obscure interior cities, like Changsha for example, and witness them building their own world trade centres, and constructing giant sky scrapers and uninhabited apartment blocks everywhere. You definitely did have to ask yourself where all this money was coming from, and whether it was being invested correctly. However, since Xi Jinping has come to power, things definitely seem to have gone backwards. He's become increasingly authoritarian, the internet is more and more difficult to use... he's started to clamp down on any of the civil society groups that had arisen in the relatively liberal period of the last decade, and he's arresting human rights lawyers, and anyone who dares to criticise him. It's getting more difficult for Chinese graduates to get jobs, the best, brightest or most wealthy are doing what they can to leave the country, and it turns out that a lot of the government spending of the last 7 years has gone into projects they can't possibly recoup a profit on... or has been lost through massive corruption. This is why you saw the recent stock market crash, because the government came up with the bright idea of encouraging the populace to buy shares in all their state owned companies, so they could balance their balance sheets and recoup some of their debt. Unfortunately, they created another bubble, to go with the property bubble, and it all came crashing down... and now they're arresting bankers and forcing them to confess on T.V to short selling the obviously insanely overvalued stocks. There are still some Chinese industries that are doing pretty well... particularly in the city I live, and generally in the more innovative south. Chinese people are also insanely good at finding opportunities to make money, and are pretty shrewd at doing business, despite the government. However, government authoritarianism has been getting ridiculous recently... and is a real drag on creativity and critical thinking. Chinese students generally just regurgitate information, and the insane censorship rules on films, for example, (look them up) mean that they're not able to develop the soft-power that American has. It's the same in the Universities... recently, for example, all none STEM Phd funding was cut, unless it was on the philosophy of Xi Jinping thought. Also, there is a real lack of transparency and accountability across society.... The government still claims to be growing the economy at 7%, but most economists and China analysts believe its at 3 or 4%. Maybe they know that there is an economic slump is coming, because they are really trying to whip up nationalism at the moment, especially against the Japanese, who are fought against and mutilated on seven different channels every night on TV. China definitely could have a great future.... but not unless the CCP falls, or rapidly reforms. At the moment I can confidently say they're not going to rule the world... nor, with their cavalier attitude to human rights, do we want them to. (P.s sorry for the huge reply)"

0,You're not all that familiar with what's going on in Quebec and Montreal eh?,"A yearly increase in tution of 125 dollars doesn't seem like much. But a combination of increases from bascially all public and private sectors does add up. If it isnt an increase in property tax, its probably an increase in plate sticker fees, or the gas bill just went up 5%. These things might not seem like much, but they add up, especially when incomes are stagnant and the dollar is falling. Its just 125 this year, but guaranteed to increase even more next year. Things will just keep on getting more expensive until the middle class no longer can afford it. No matter what politician you elect, long term solutions are never a mindset or priority. What gets you elected are short term promises of economic prosperity, and since all politicians care about now a days is getting elected even that is put on the back burner. As for banning protests, theres quite the shady area in bill C51 that could affect the way protests are handled."

Or the time you sat with me in business class talking to me for hours trying to get my mind off it. Thank you for the help, and the smile you always had when coming over for the 20th time with a cup of water at almost midnight... I always felt bad, and you probably hate it, but you've helped my flight experiences tenfold. I respect you all immensely, so thank you all.

Then depending on how all that goes I'll start thinking about making a new stunting subframe. Not really sure what direction I'll go because I kind of like the look of the longer rear fairing thing on my bike and on dirtbikes in general. And then turbo it.

I'd play against actual players on the actual top teams sometimes and they were fucking insane at that game. Now there was a dude called Star_ or something who made YouTube vids. He was like the WarOwl of TF2. Less tutorials, though. A good player who's super popular on YouTube, makes content generally for worse players. Now the fucking annoying thing about Star wasn't even him, he seemed like a chill dude, it was his fucking fans. ""Star is the best TF2 player!"" Dude that shit tilts me so often. I knew what the best fucking players were like, I'd been destroyed by them, and I could destroy Star, and it's so fucking frustrating when super casual people spout and believe stuff like that. Warowl's got a similar thing going on, where a few (much less than Star) people think he's one of the best players, or could easily go pro or whatever just because he's a good player.

They go inside (I think the house belonged to the guys family), and it looks like it's been abandoned for a while, as there's sheets draped over the furniture. Bad guys are getting closer, and I'm pretty sure they have a kid with them, and they go through this closet/pantry that leads to a hidden tunnel to escape, they come out a good distance away from the house and you can see it starting to burn in the background as they continue to flee.

We have had sex without a condom twice (seconds only) when we can't wait to have sex, but we immediately stop and I put a condom on. Because of this, I've seen how she enjoys sex the most without a condom and so do I. It's amazingly different! I would like us to try it once, and I was wondering if we'd be idiots if we tried and then just use an emergency pill (we have never tried that). I know this increases her chances of getting pregnant, but is there actually an enormous difference between the effectiveness of a condom and an emergency pill? Am I crazy for wanting this?

What part of not wanting children is expecting society to do all the work for them? The answer would be as simple as getting themselves sterilized, except that most doctors would not allow anyone who doesn't already have a child (or two in some places) a strong issue with their reproductive organs (Ex: Polycystic ovary syndrome, severe torsion of the testis) or is nearing the end of their child-producing years, to get sterilized. One friend of mine, only managed to convince his doctor to let him get a visectomy after he and his wife had four children. (She was on birth control for when she got pregnant with the last two, but she got pregnant anyways, &amp; They don't agree with abortions.) At least for the moment, as long as getting sterilization prodedures are held off on as much a possible, then we're putting ourselves ripe in the position of having more children than we want."

Dungeon Crawl Classics- after reading the adventure frozen in time I want to run this and have crazy time travel elements be a part of the campaign. 3. Exalted 3e - if for no other reason than to feel like I got my money's worth out of the stupid kickstarter. 4. Any WOD game - I have never played WoD and really want to run one of the 20th anniversary games. 5. Trail of Cthulhu- either Bookhounds of London or Eternal Lies. 6. Nights Black Agents - My two plans are either running Dracula Dossier or my own campaign with mutated vampires from a debunked soviet bio weapons program. That's all I can think of off the top of my head. What about you guys what are your goals for 2016?

0,"The last sentence doesn't really make sense at all, you can't get wrecked against a plat main jungle because you don't even choose jungle as a position.","Why does this game force its players into specific roles Thought about this while reading dynamic q complain threads. Yes I understand pros have main roles and that most people have a preferred role that they are much better at than others. But wouldn't it be better for the game to have a more rounded out casual player base that is pretty decent at every part of the game? Most of league players never will or don't want to be pros, we just enjoy the competition and the game is fun. Now with this ranked system, before the game starts you have to decide which roles you want to play, completely ruling out the possibility of playing the other 3 roles. Probably from Plat up there is a significant skill level difference between your main and other roles, but below Plat I don't think the gap is that big. So the game should encourage people to try out every role to some degree so a Plat adc main can jungle somewhat effectively and not get completely wrecked going up against a Plat jungle and single handedly lose the game."

I'd like to keep that as the absolute max. This is what I had in mind: Motherboard : Gigabyte GA-H81M-S2H CPU : Intel Core i5-4460 3.2Ghz HD : WD Blue 1TB SATA3 (In my current PC, will re-use it) GPU : Gigabyte GeForce GTX 750 Ti OC Windforce 2GB GDDR5 (Might get a 950 instead if it's worth it) RAM : G.Skill Aegis DDR3 1600 PC3-12800 8GB CL11 DVD Unit : LG GH24NSD1 (Already have it, will reuse it) Power : Tacens Mars Gaming 700W Case : NOX Coolbay SX USB 3.0 That's the basic build. Later on I'd like to add an SSD, a sound card (for music production) and appropiate cooling. But that would be once I can afford it. Please let me know if I'm getting the best stuff for that price limit, or any recommendations of things you'd add/remove. Thanks in advance!"

Its hard to even believe I went through that process, its so hard for him to have fun when hes matched against smurfs who easily destroy him in lane.

(Generator was covered in sawdust.) Unscrewed gas cap and it restarted then ran great. Current model Toro 22"" recycler mower w/ 7HP Briggs &amp; Stratton 190 motor, also curbside. Competely covered in fine dust, air filter clogged, and carb fuel bowl likely full of mud, would not start. I need to to the basics first and I think I can get it going. Two years ago I got a mint Troy-Bilt mower **from the same house** in the same condition. After clean-up it ran great and I use it currently. Finally, mid-2000s Gary Fisher Tarpon mixte bike in great shape, free sign on it at yard sale. Both tires flat, one off rim, and the chain was stuck in the front derailleur.

The keyboard is starting to have issues where sometimes you have to lean on specific keys to make them work, it's missing a platen, the charging jack is getting loose, it runs warm, one of the speakers is busted, I mean this poor thing has been through the mill.

0,"Much like raisins in cookies, Soap Opera Effect is a crime against humanity and should be eliminated from existence as soon as possible.","Why so much hate towards Soap Opera effect? I was just curious on people's opinion on the general overwhelming hate towards the soap opera effect caused by 120-240Hz displays? I see a lot of people turning the feature off on their TVs, while I absolutely love the smoothness it brings. I admit, when I first bought my Samsung UN55C7000 (240hz) 6 years ago, the effect looked odd to my wife and I and took AT LEAST an entire month to get use too, but now we can't go back. Just as I upgraded my gaming monitor to 144Hz, the difference was staggering and I could never go back to 60Hz. If you're gaming on your TV the effect usually increases input lag unless you switch gaming mode on, which removes the effect to lower input lag. If you prefer the highest fps possible during gaming, why wouldn't you prefer it on movies where input lag is a non-factor? I understand that in movies/tv shows, the effect seems to make content seem less ""epic"" so to speak, but in turn makes it seem more realistic as if you are right there with the actors. I always notice more detail in everything because the motion blur/choppyness is completely eliminated. Would love to hear your opinion on whether you prefer it on or off and your reasons. Please include how long you have used the feature if possible due to it taking quite a long time to get used to. Cheers!"

There are many reasons, but one of them is that they don't want to vote for the ""lesser of two evils"". They feel disenfranchised with the political system, that none of the candidates really represent their views or interests. So they don't see it as worthwhile. Sanders actually has an opportunity to change that. He is getting many young people, and other people who typically do not vote, to be excited about politics for the first time. Will all of them vote? No. Will millennials vote in greater numbers than baby boomers? No. Will we see the highest youth voter turnout in decades? I believe we will. And I really want to emphasize the ""Hillary supporters will vote for Sanders"" part again. In the face of a fascist GOP candidate like Trump (or Cruz, or ...) establishment Democrats will have no choice."

Question 2 for current owners : What price would you ask for while selling your high end cards knowing that in coming fall a 200 dollarish gtx 1060 could be faster than yours.

We've been monitoring the atmosphere's composition closely, any significant biochemically energetic life would have left noticeable traces - not to mention the *huge* traces that Mad Maxian vehicle engines and other facilities would be spewing out. If a rover sent back pictures of something like that, the only plausible explanation is that the rover's been hacked by pranksters or something. New images from orbital assets would be taken to confirm that the terrain is still as it was before the rover went down and the rover's operating system would be examined with a fine-toothed comb. The problem would be found and corrected and NASA would be intensely embarrassed that their security had been breached so flagrantly.

0,"Its all one big circlejerk, its a subreddit full of people patting themselves on the back saying ""its alright guys we play the better game""","Hey, honest question here. I use AlienTube, a google extension that works when I go to a YouTube video. I can see all the places where the specific video has been posted on reddit. In a lot of videos that include league of legends bugs or I guess just negative videos, I see that they've been posted to this subreddit. So, this subreddit is to basically glorify Dota and say all the other MOBAs suck? But I mean, what's the point, really? If you're so sure that Dota, or whatever game you like is better than its competitors, why would you need to CONSTANTLY go over that with post after post bashing on another game for no reason? To me, it really just shows immaturity and insecurity. Obviously, League has plenty of bugs, but I'm sure Dota has plenty as well? What's the point in posting them? In one post of a bug, someone said: ""They probably don't have a sandbox mode so people don't discover those bugs"" What the fuck? Why would that be true at all? It's like these people have a fucking superiority complex, they call people who play a different game from them ""PEASANTS""! Jeez... just sounds like a terrible community to me. Once again, just honest confusion here. I don't hate Dota. But for some reason everyone here hates LoL."

And from what little I have seen of the show, they seem to genuinely love each other, rather than those on other reality shows who only scream at each other. Honey Boo Boo might just turn out alright. Certainly not like Senator alright, but not fucked up at least."

We both went there today when we heard the news, as he was worried about his friends. Apart from the two that got hurt, everyone seemed mostly fine, if not concerned. My brother knew the shooter personally, and says that he was definitely a bit unhinged since the first grade. We started speculating why he would do this, and well... it sounds like he had a specific target in mind. He wasn't going in to shoot up his classmates; rather, he had a teacher targeted. That would explain why there were only two injuries... which, by the way, only one of those was via gunshot. Arapahoe High is known throughout the LPS district as the school that allows open campus and variable scheduling to all grades. Freshmen through seniors are allowed to leave the school at will, provided they aren't supposed to be in class. That said, the shooting happened during the fourth period. Half the school was at lunch or roaming the hallways, and the other half was back in class. This guy certainly had much opportunity to shoot more people, but he didn't. We think that as soon as he got to where he thought his target would be, he started panicking. The teacher was nowhere to be found, and he started to realize what he had just done. So he went to the library and shot himself. Like I said, this is our speculation, and shouldn't be taken as fact."

0,"I'm plenty late to the party, but correct me if I'm wrong, you cannot efficiently goblin knife at th8 because you don't have the jump spell?","Why are people downvoting this guy? Every single one of us had a moment when we learned what it was. This community is a place where people can ask questions, even if they are obvious. By downvoting beginner level questions, the community discourages anyone from asking questions. I've learned a ton from this sub and a lot of it was because of people answering questions like this. Goblin Knife is a farming or pushing strategy that focuses on getting a mass of goblins into the core of a base to quickly kill the TH and DE storage. Most successful attacks result in about 20% damage done, but a huge amount of DE stolen and a one star attack. This is accomplished by using 4-12 giants, some archers or goblins, and some wbs to create a funnel and break through the outer layer of the base. Then use a jump or quadquake to get to the core. Drop a few goblins to clear away any other buildings between the exterior and the core, then do a two finger drop to unload as many goblins as possible as fast as you can on a path to the core. Drop a rage and heal in the core and it's over. There are several good examples on this sub and on youtube as well as tips for making it work better. The beauty of it is that it works at every TH level from 8-11. It usually results in a one star win so you can maintain or even climb in trophies. It is a very very cheap army (requiring almost no DE) and trains fairly quickly. It often only uses 2-3 spells and your heroes usually don't take much damage. When you use it, try to look for bases that have the TH and DE storage close to each other. Note where the wiz towers/mortars/multi infernos are and avoid them or plan for them with heal/rage/freeze. Visualize the path the goblins will take to get to the core and make sure you clear any resource buildings that will lure the goblins away. Last, check for potential gb spots that could ruin the whole thing. With practice, you'll be wrecking fools in no time."

0,"Yeah, I know I'm in the minority but I also prefer other Gundam series to Zeta.","When does Zeta start getting interesting / good(Spoilers) So last time we talked, I was at Episode 5 and not feeling Kamille or the AEUG really. I am at episode 30 now. Over half-way. I started watching the original Gundam first, expecting to not like it because of it's age, dated animation, and probably simplicity of plot. It was rushed, but I enjoyed it, I enjoyed the fight scenes, I enjoyed char, and I enjoyed Amuro's development into a real character. Here comes Zeta, it's direct continuation. We start of with a kid who has serious issues, where he is willing to murder a guy for calling him by his name, which is feminine, but I am not talking simply beat him up, he will hijack a Gundam and stomp him into paste...I cannot like this character. He seems insane. Things do not get better for the first 15 episodes. Amuro then comes in, but is suffering from PTSD and depression. Still, he manages to make stuff cool. Oh yeah, I guess Char was in there for abit, and suddenly everyone really like Char and believe he should rule everything. Huh, times change, I guess. So Kamille sucks as a Gundam pilot. He never rises about mediocre piloting so far, meanwhile Amuro may have been a little bit too much of a savant, but at least it felt natural, he felt scared and he slowly grew until he was unstoppable. Kamille loses every fight he's in. The enemy -always- retreats. NO MAJOR DEATHS, 30 EPISODES IN. By major, I mean any character actually relevant to the story. In the original Gundam, we had major characters dropping every 5-6 episodes, which made it all feel very tense. I actually like Jerid, but he's getting way to villainy of the week. He just runs away and comes back next time - with the same plan, nothing changed, gets beat again. Then there's the ""Zeta Gundam"", after the Mark II Gundam being largely just another Mobile Suit and nothing special at all, I figured Zeta would have to be, given the anime is named after it. So what do we get? It's introduced and it's...the same Gundam equipment, tactics, ect, we've seen before. Oh it can transform now, but it doesn't really seem to have anything special beyond being a transformer. At least not so far has it shown itself to be in any way superior to the Mark II, despite the heavy foreshadowing at the start of the series. The Titans objectives are all over the place, the Earth's Federation makes no sense ""Ok guys, we give you total control of our forces"" - So now they want to wipe all of Earth out and then like repopulate it. Really, it comes down to one word ""Spacenoids"" What the fuck? The villains suck in this, and Char is INTERESTING, but he's way to slow burning to be 30 episodes in and no meaningful development with him. Also, why do the fights suck? The animation is obviously far superior to do being 7 years older than the original, as well as the cells...and yet all of the fights are fucking terrible compared to the Original Gundam. None of them feel tense, all the mobile suits look alike and generic. They pop out tons of models and it can be confusing as hell. We learn about so many things that are never explored or just down-right ignored. I was honestly excited as hell for Zeta, because Gundam Original blew my expectations out of the water for being a really great anime. Then I read about Zeta, and the rave reviews of ""BEst Gundam ever"" ""Zeta is really the series that defined Gundam as a whole, and made it a timeless classic."" What the hell? I mean, I got 20 more episodes to go, I know, but it's going to have to change -alot- to get me convinced. * Also, people told me to ""Keep an eye on Emma, she's the standout character of this series"" - So, does that happen in the last 20 episodes? Cause so far she is entirely forgettable. No meaningful development or purpose yet. Why is every female character ""out to prove herself"", and then proves herself completely useless? It's just abit...dumb. Fa is such an annoying character she makes Frau Bo look good."

If I want to work more than someone else to earn more than them, why should I be prevented from doing so? To me, that's the antithesis of freedom. And, I don't see a boss or a CEO of an authority at all as I am voluntarily working for him/her. I am not being coerced to ""serve"" for him/her. I would argue that left anarchism is a contradiction and isn't anarchism as some sort of central authority must be present to force the redistribution of wealth. Right?

0,I think you replied to the wrong person.,"There's a big difference, but it's just semantics. I'm pro-choice. But do you really feel the same way about someone losing blood as about someone having a miscarriage? Do you honestly know when life begins? Do you think that fetus is ever alive? Or just after it's born? Because that's what the bodily autonomous argument logically leads to: third trimester abortions. And I don't think anyone is arguing for that. And if you say. ""No, I meant able to live outside the womb!"" I can ask again. Do you honestly know when life begins? A fetus that is possibly alive but can't survive outside its mother is equal to blood or an organ? The only valid argument for allowing abortions in my opinion is that it saves lives. It's better than the alternative of making it illegal. I think if we focused on that aspect, more people would be pro-choice. If we continue to argue along ideological lines we will simply come to a stand-off. Pro-lifers think life begins at conception and believers in pro-choice do not. Just saying that fetuses are not ""bodily autonomous"" seems like a weak argument to me. Does a fetus really have the same value as blood or an organ?"

And his son *SHOULDN'T* know Margo well unless they've been dating for more than a year. And we have no evidence that OP fucked up by keeping his dating life private from his ex. The evidence that OP provides indicates that his ex is toxic. The fact that his ex tried to enlist friends to cyberstalk his fiancee lends more credence to that. Validating his ex's stalking and public trash-talking is the worst thing that he could do. He needs to send his ex an email saying that he will not speak ill of her, and he expects her to do the same with regard to him and Margo, for the sake of their son. As for helping his son, OP needs to find a child therapist to find out how to best help his son with this transition, so that he still feels secure, but that might not be at issue at all, since OP doesn't give us any evidence for that either way."

When I first found out that foreskin was supposed to be able to freely retract I was scared. Since I was probably 11 or 12 till 17 I have been masturbating with the foreskin completely up when erect and I had no problems. Once I tried to retract as many of you know, it was extremely painful. I could barely get the skin to go halfway down the glands and not to mention the glands WERE SO FUCKING SENSITIVE. I did my research and learned that circumcision is a last resort and I should stretch and slowly work my way to getting the glands fully exposed. After months of diligent stretching my foreskin was fully retractable erect and flaccid without any issues at all! So here comes my question: What are some ways to get my glands to be less sensitive? Stimulating the naked head and frenulum feels like HEAVEN! Every orgasm I have feels like im temporarily going blind from all the pleasure. I am just worried that I am too sensitive that I won't last long at all when I do finally have sex. For a majority of my life I have been missing out on some truly amazing pleasure but I really want to be able to last when I am with my (future) partner and make sure she is satisfied before I get mine :).

0,"Gamergate is a type of ant, amirite?","Question about Gamergate identity I am gonna ask a question about how you determine if someone is Gamergate or not. I subscribe to KiA for more than 1 year but i dont know if i am part of Gamergate or not, because i am too lazy to take an active part in Gamergate. If i am about to pick an ""identity"", maybe silent reader is the most correct one. And now i want to move to a part where me myself have only little understanding about it, so please fill me in if there is some fact that I wrote is wrong. There is a group that call themself Gamergate and active on doxxing people (i think it was baphomet from 4chan) but here at KiA, you all saying that they are not part of Gamergate. But who is has the power to saying someone is not Gamergate or not? Gamergate are leaderless. If everyone is equal here, than why someone opinion is better than the next person. If someone say he is Gamergate, how you can you explain to other people that he is not part of Gamergate because they take part at activity that you not approve (to be clear, i also dont approve doxxing), because, once again, i think every other person opinion here is equal, because there is no rank here at Gamergate. If you said they are not part of Gamergate because majority of people said so, what if, hypothetically, the ""dox"" Gamergate is the majority, will they become the true Gamergate? Right now what im seeing is, Gamergate has its own different faction. Even the user here often have different opinion on the same thread, and maybe the different in opinion is greater with Gamergate outside reddit (is 8chan Gamergate still considered same faction with reddit Gamergate?). And with that i back to my original question, how you determine someone is Gamergate or not?"

0,Where abouts are you looking to open?,"Although this idea recently took off with someone else. Hey Kickstarter! I have always wanted to open up a gaming bar in the bay area and wanted some opinions on what you guys think? 1. What is your product or service? I have always wanted to open up a gaming bar in the Bay Area similar to one that will recently open up in San Jose. The gaming community is absolutely huge in California with multiple gaming headquarters here and the recent surge of popularity of gaming, it is an amazing opportunity to bring out a place where many people can meet new gamers and connect on a hobby they enjoy! Besides the bar and gaming, it will also be host to multiple (daily?) tournaments that will use the entry fees and sponsorships for cash prizes to boost popularity. 2. What motivated you to start a business? I have always grew up in a family that started their own businesses and strictly believe in the saying that if you enjoy what you do, you aren't working at all. 3. How long have you been working on your startup? Although I haven't properly worked on it yet, I do have some basic ideas as far as name, set-up, and marketing tools. 4. My 6-month plan is to have the project at least 50% funded through private investors and/or Kickstarter, Indiegogo. My 1-year plan is to have the location under contract and either functional or near completion. I am hoping everything is fully functional in 1.5 years. My 5-year plan is to grow the business into a household name with another possible location in Southern California, or slowly expand to the East Coast. 5. What have been your more positive and negative experiences? The most positive experience I had was very recently when I saw that someone with a very similar idea had their project funded and ready to open later on this month. If they can do it, why can't I? In the long run, it isn't even about competition, it's about bringing a proper light to a very popular hobby, and making it into a central hub they would love to visit. The negative experiences I have with this is the lack of support or the people I explain this to, thinks it will have 0 demand. 1. I would give myself the advice of starting early and start saving. The demand is definitely there, I just need the push to start it and to look for a potential partner that can share this passion just as much. Let me know what you guys think Reddit! And I am also looking for a partner in the area that can share this passion with me and dedicate a decent amount of time into getting what we need."

The crushing sexual poverty in which we exist *cannot* and *will not* stand. All your trolling, mocking us in other subs, brigading, and mashing the report button like the whiny little snitches you are, is absolutely MEANINGLESS. As you can see, we are still here. Does that anger you normies? Do you feel a twinge of *fear* when you realize that the INCEL movement hasn't been halted, but rather, is gaining steam and momentum with each and every injustice you heap upon us? By all means, get angrier. Continuing invading our space with your spam and downvotes and reports. *It will do you no good.* **THE INCEL REVOLUTION CANNOT BE STOPPED.** Your tyranny WILL be overthrown and, as I have said from the beginning, there WILL come a reckoning.

Each of these have weaknesses and resistances to particular damage types, e.g. the 'infested flesh' health types take +50% damage from heat damage but -50% from cold damage. Therefore a gun that deals 100 heat damage will actually do 150 damage to infested flesh while a gun that deals 100 cold damage will only deal 50 damage to infested flesh. You can view the effects of damage modifiers by clicking on 'details' in Warframe builder. Some enemies also have armor on top of their health however, which will reduce all damage depending on how high their armor is. These are also effected by damage modifiers, e.g. corrosive deals +75% damage to ferrite armor. Warframe builder does not consider this damage reduction nor can you look at your damage by considering the damage modifiers against both their health and armor at the same time. In addition, these damage modifiers will also determine how greatly that damage is affected by armor damage reduction, e.g. corrosive damage will be calculated as if the target had 75% less ferrite armor on top of its +75% damage bonus. Again, Warframe builder does not consider this. In short, the damage numbers listed in the 'details' panel should be accurate for enemies without armor but you can see huge differences against enemies that do have armor due to the limited number of factors Warframe builder considers when calculating DPS."

The exceptions are Fire Mage, MM Hunter, and S. Priest. I've read repeatedly that people felt Melee should do more damage than ranged. This is now, for the most part, true. 2. Seven specs (Frost DK down) appear to be at a very clear disadvantage. The other specs have a relatively small spread. Ignoring the 7 I've said are obviously worse, the spread between the top spec (enhancement Shaman) and bottom spec (Destro Lock [my personal spec]) is 30k DPS (roughly 11%). Not a negligible amount, but when you consider you'll never have perfect balance, not a terrible spread either. My takeaway from this is that MM, Fire Mage, and S. Priest need nerfs to be brought in line with the other ranged specs while Frost DK, Survival, and Fury need to be buffed to be brought in line with the other melee specs. Aff, BM, Ele, and Frost Mage probably need buffs too."

0,"If you are not in a huge rush, I'd wait until Nov for the new expac so you don't have to pay twice in 2 months.","There is a lot of heroic grouping to be done in ToV. They changed itemization in ToV, so there is more of a progression from solo, heroic, raid. To the point where a fully upgraded Tier 2 heroic pieces (Potent 3/3) is stronger than an un upgraded T1 raid piece( Energized 0/1). Not to mention that the hardest heroic zone has some of the best charms in the game. So there is plenty to do imo without the raiding time sink. Buying ToV will get you CoE (which is pretty much obsolete and you can skip it buy leveling in a contested zone) AoD isn't really 100% necessary but it is super useful. The mercs are one of the best things you can have when leveling solo as they let you basically run old heroics by yourself. And reforging is pretty important too in ToV with the change in how armor and stats are."

Just means you aren't a match to him or his lesson. My mantra: Everyone is a teacher and a mirror, if you just open yourself to look. Namaste friend."

Al Gore never stoked the flames of voter fraud BEFORE the election., like Trump is doing. Now, Sanders is a different story. He did stoke ""fraud"" theory, but not in the same way. Sanders never said that dead people and illegals were voting for Hillary because of a vast conspiracy against him. Instead, he claimed that the primary process, which is a clusterfuck, worked against him with closed caucuses and primaries. Sanders instead, proposed an open system of primaries. (And Hillary supporters got fucking pissed for that, but fuck them. Sanders just wanted more to vote). So, NO. Let me say this a couple since Donald does not understand the word ""No"". NO.

Anyways I'm curious to hear what yours are and why My top three are: 1. Shadows of Evil I've never read anyone here say that they like the map and honestly I cannot comprehend it as it is my all time fave. I like the rituals, the map lay-out, the swords (omg the swords are so dope) but most of all THE THEME. Demonic gods from other dimensions and creepy robe wearing abominations are my SHIT! 2. Mob of the Dead Nowadays I don't play Bo2 maps anymore because of that annoying mechanic that lets the last zombie die out of loneliness but holy shit did I love Mob of the Dead. Again the theme of hell and satan and all had me gravitating towards the map anyways but long ass complicated quests really get to me in a good way. Also the tomahawk. 3. Tranzit I know I'm not the only one who likes it and I know Tranzit had one or two (or ten) mistakes and things that didn't need to be there. For me personally the turbines and these fucking foggy baby atrocities need to leave this map that has so much potential I think my style of maps are big spacey creepy maps that take some time to get set up in and I hope I can get into ZnS since it is a pretty dope map.

Assuming that the 4-cylinder is physically smaller than the 12-cylinder engine, I would guess that it would leave more room for the crumpling zones to deform in the event of a crash. So is crash safety a factor when deciding which engine to pick for your new car? I've been searching around for some insight on this, but I can't even find any other people asking about this, let alone coming up with an answer...

When the gods were hosting some dudes wedding they didn't invite her. She obviously didn't like this as she was still a god and therefore should be treated by disrespect. So she decided to do what she does best and make everyone hate each other by planting a golden apple that was inscribed with the words: ""To the fairest"". Hera, Athene and Aphrodite all thought they deserved it but they couldn't settle it themselves. So they asked Zeus, who was smart enough to say hell no i'm not picking a side here. So he asked Paris to pick instead. All three goddesses tried to bribe him, however he eventually chose Aphrodite because she offered him a girl. The others didn't like this so they made sure that the girl he wanted was really taken, so much so that if something happened to her all of greece would rise up to fight to get her back. Paris then decided that it was worth and decided to kidnap her anyway. Then everyone decided that the guy was a dick and his city should be burned to the ground with everyone in it. And so the Trojan war began and millions died. All because someone ""forgot"" to invite the goddess of ""fuck you""."

JS was true, but BY and later screwed it up? I cannot find any information about this, so I thought I'd ask here. There are some people in our ward who have gotten all excited about a new way of seeing mormonism. They keep saying that they are ""enlightened"" and that the current church is in apostacy. They are still coming to church, maybe to recruit? They've quit their callings and it sounds like they're not paying tithing or anything. They have some psychologist person in Utah who is their ""mentor"" helping them figure out the ""real gospel of Jesus"" that was taught by Joseph Smith, but obscured later. One thing mentioned was that we are all a lot closer to God's level of power than we realize. If they wanted to, they could eventually move things with their minds/godly power. It sounded very Jedi to me. They've noticed that I have some non-mainstream ideas, so it seems I may be a candidate for recruiting. I'm very curious, but I'd like to understand who they are before investigating. I have no intention of believing any of it, but it seems like something that could really hurt the church, so I'm interested. There are several families in my ward who seem to be involved, and I'm wondering where it's heading. Does anybody have any idea what this is? Where I can find more info on it?"

On the corner of 45th and Guadalupe (next to the Walgreens) some ""luxury condos"" are being built, like the rest of the city. But it's been two years now of almost constant construction noise, from 6 am to sometimes as late as 8 or 9 pm. Every day. Weekends, holidays, it doesn't matter and it's driving people in the area nuts. I work at home so it has been disrupting my ability to concentrate on work, I have a couple friends who are still in school who cannot do their homework. Apparently it has been causing breakdowns to the point of not being able to handle being in their own apartments. I know I've spent my share of time screaming ""SHUT UP"" toward a closed window, wishing they'd here me. My friend and I are at our wits end and need help. What are our options? We've been so patient for almost 2 years now. This can't be just something they can do because they have the money. Do I have a right to live in peace? I have no way of knowing if they are breaking any noise ordinances. I looked up what they are in Austin, and I don't know if they are breaking any of them. Is anyone else experiencing the same thing in other areas? Or maybe you're in the same area. I'm thinking I'm going to file noise complaints with the police because I don't have any more patience.

0,What you smell is the scent of desperation on the part of Sanders supporters.,"What a garbage article. Firstly, Nate's projections don't even work in these states because there's no useful polling in those states. None. It all dates back to early february, and some have no data like Hawaii. Making predictions on polls a month old is worthless. A ton of stuff has happened since early February. Will Sanders win most if not all those states? Yes. That was obvious since 6 out of 8 of them are caucuses which Sanders does much better at. This is the first of two reasons why there's no polling data for these states. It is incredibly difficult to poll a caucus because of the complexity of the system involved. The second reason is that the seven states in between Arizona and New York add up to a grand total of 298 delegates. So even if he were to win 100% of all of them, he still wouldn't fully erase her lead. New York has 247 delegates all by itself which she's going to win. The desperation in this subreddit hits new LOLs every day. Everyone had better get their meals ready for massive amounts of salt once California and New Jersey come and he gets stomped."

Mondays through Fridays (i believe) they ship and access their email. Ive done business with them by email with them for a while and theyve always been so good to me that they are the only vendor i go to on the darkweb. Last tuesday i deposited money for a rather large order. They emailed me that day saying it would ship the same day. Then they emailed me wednesday night saying it would ship thursday. I paid an extra $60 for express 2 day. So that would put the arrival at saturday or monday at the worst. They usually dont check their email on weekends so them not replying to my messages over the weekend didnt concern me. But theyre always prompt about emailing back and i didnt hear from them thursday, friday, monday, or tuesday. And out of curiousity i checked the blockchain for the address they gave me and they have withdrawals from the address all 4 days. So maybe im paranoid and if so i apologize in advance to Weedgirls because theyve always been my favorite vendor but it feels to me like something shady. Figured id post so reddit can comment. This isnt a complaint or a scam post just looking for opinions."

You can fedi dungeon with resets and tomes to 190 (you will vomit from all the golems you kill) or you can actually quest. roughly. Every run can take 10-20 minutes so this is where the bulk of time will be spent on either questing or dungeon reset missions. 190 dungeon 3x on 300% can get you into the 200s easily or you can almeth anyways at a low level, probably 3-4 hours at almeth with 300% tome will get you to 248. an hour or 2 at storage will get you to maven levels, 3 hours at maven will get you to 290 levels which you can go to timery.

This isn't an an especially bad thing as long as it's entertaining, and for the most part it is. It's a very pretty game, kind of clever, and it's clear they had fun coming up with all the character traits and items and missions and whatnot. What it isn't is polished. It's buggy - the inability to get certain required items is particularly frustrating - and this is having quite an impact on gameplay and enjoyability. A quick look at the posts here confirms that easily enough. My hope however is that this is fixable. The latest update fixed a number of things for me, and if they keep on polishing it this could be an excellent game, in time (no pun intended). Right now, it's just okay."

I've kinda screwed it up a bit So, I graduated in May, and now I'm here, at home, and I haven't properly applied to a college, and only just took the ACT on the 8th. I went through high school with poor grades, and I failed a few(like five) classes and my cumulative GPA was like, 2.5. I really messed up, I know, but I'm not dumb, I swear. Honestly, I'm considered one of the smartest kids in my school, and that combined with my laziness is what spelled my doom. I got bad grades because nothing was a challenge, everything was way too easy, so I didn't want to do it. I love learning, but my classes taught me little, and I don't like redundancy. I'm a good kid, though. I only got like five minor write-ups for sleeping and getting on my phone. My peers will tell you I'm smart and kind. I was never rude and never intrusive. Maybe even to the point where it was a bad thing. I ghosted through high school, though and made little friends and didn't get involved in any extracurricular activities. Anyway, back to my main point. I'm at home, with no awards, poor grades, no outgoing applications, and no idea what the f to do. I'm probably screwed, but if I'm not: Please, help me. I'm really scared that I'm doomed to live on this reservation forever. Did I mention I am a Native American who comes from one of the poorest counties in America with a per capita income of $7,714? 5th lowest btw. Luckily, my mom and step-mom, (yes, they're in a homosexual partnership) are working hard to raise me and my two brothers. I've known poverty, and I've known hunger. Everyone here has, and I'm scared. I don't want to be here forever. I want to see the world. I still have dreams. I just need guidance. So please, if you can, help me. Any and all advice is welcome. Also, I understand my past laziness must go, and I've been struggling with that coupled with depression. The depression is from previous mental abuse(not from my moms, no.) that just stuck around. I still find it hard to look at myself in the mirror without crying. I often feel worthless and like I'll amount to nothing, but that's something I have been dealing with. The thing I'm lost on is college. Where do I go? Who do I talk to? What can I do? Sorry if this was too long, but I'm desperate. Again, any advice is welcome. So, please, tell me what you can. I'll respond to everything, so conversations are welcome. Sorry for the lack of proper paragraphs."

Look up famous aircraft from WWII. Some of the most successful ones had rocky beginnings. I live a couple of miles away from MCAS Yuma and see the F-35 on training flights almost every day. No, I don't know anyone working on the program. However, they *are* using them constantly and haven't put one in the ground yet. Recently, I read a local article about how they've started putting practice bombs on the F-35 and are dropping them at the Goldwater range. It might take a couple more years for the F-35 to become fully operational, but it looks like they're working on it. The Osprey also had trouble in the beginning, but I see ones that come over from El Centro all the time.

Also hannukah overlaps with winter breaks so that doesnt matter and i doubt any of these events are going to be these massive time sinks that require you to sit at your pc all day, It will probably be a free loot box everyday or something. There is no reason they cant celebrate another holiday. hell if they really wanted they could move the dates to work better with the christmas days but still have it be another holiday. There is literally no reason what so ever that they cant do some other holiday. Do you know how much publicity they would get if they did some smaller holiday? It would be all over the gaming websites and it would have tons of people talking about it and practically nobody would be angry about it because like i said, no matter what they are going to get something out of it.

0,No wonder his name is John shmuk,"I emailed my Congressman about the net neutrality killing rider that's been attached in the stopgap funding bill. His response is some of the biggest horseshit I've read in a while and I wanted to share it with you all My Congressman's response: I would like to thank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). I appreciate hearing about issues that are important to my constituents. As you may know, net neutrality refers to the principle of the open and free internet. Under this principle Internet Service Providers (ISP) provide equal access to all lawful internet traffic, and consumers are free to choose what content they wish to access. The main focus of debate over net neutrality has been whether the current regulatory framework is sufficient for policy makers to address this issue, or whether they should look to Congress to amend current law. Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was passed into law, new technologies and advancements in telecommunications have rapidly developed due to the limited government regulation of internet traffic and services. However, on February 26th, 2015, the FCC voted to reclassify broadband Internet as a telecommunication service under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This essentially allows the FCC to reclassify broadband as a utility giving the FCC more regulatory authority over Internet providers. Over the past 20 years the Internet has changed the way we live our lives, from how we get the news to how we pay our bills. Now the FCC is reaching back 80 years for their authority to reclassify broadband Internet service as a public utility, a move that will not only open the Internet up to heavier regulations and additional taxes, but would disincentive the development and deployment of faster Internet service throughout the nation. While President Obama and Chairman Wheeler continue their short sighted approach to net neutrality I hope to use my position as a member of the Communication and Technology Subcommittee to push for a bi-partisan solution that will help keep the internet open and free while incentivizing the build-out of broadband services and spurring innovation in the marketplace. The Subcommittee is currently discussing draft legislation, which I support, that would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit blocking lawful content, throttling data, and paid prioritization. Moving forward please be assured that I will keep your views in mind as we continue to work on this important issue. Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me. If you would like to keep up on this and other important issues you can follow me on Facebook, Twitter or sign up for my electronic newsletter. Sincerely, JOHN SHIMKUS Member of Congress"

I'm not here to do an in depth political analysis of trump (or candidates like him) however. Almost everything he's said has either been non-committal, wrong or in some cases war crimes.

0,I've noticed that some colors of LED just aren't as bright when driven with the same voltage and same resistor.,"That's why I think there's something wrong with the circuit/wiring. Red LEDs have a lower forward voltage than green ones, so if you use both without proper resistors, all the available current will go through the red LED. That's bad for both the LED and the Arduino and could damage/destroy them. Also, 10k is way too high. They should be barely on with that kind of resistor, which makes me think it's not connected properly. Something in the 180-330 Ohm range would be ideal. Here's how you want to connect them: (pin11)-------(220 Ohm)-------(LED)-------(GND) (pin12)-------(220 Ohm)-------(LED)-------(GND) (pin13)-------(220 Ohm)-------(LED)-------(GND) It's important that the resistor is in series with the LED."

Whenever it happens I get out of bed, walk it off, and return to sleep; it's never really effected me and I never made a big deal out of it. So last night I wake up and have that static feeling in my leg before it happens, so as I go to get up it sets in. I stumbled out of bed as my calves tensed up and I struggled to get to my light switch (which is next to my wardrobe on the other side of the room). I feel around to find the light switch and begin going backwards, thinking I had walked too far; at which point the cramp gets MUCH worse. I grab the wardrobe door handle which proceeds to swing open and drag me along with it. The sole of my foot very conveniently found it's way to a plug lying face-up on my bedroom floor and I immediately fall to the ground from the intense pain in my legs and feet. However, I landed arse first onto my laptop... Which had my iphone lying on top of it. The cracking sound was undeniable and after sitting there in a pool of despair and cradling my burning legs I get up and manage to find the light switch. One of the hinges of my wardrobe door had broken off. My iPhone was in pieces and both the laptop screen and keyboard had broken apart in consistent chunks. The worst part? Nothing's insured, I've had the phone a week and the laptop 3 months. fml."

0,yes.,"Valve please update the badge system compared to CSGO So over the years that we all play and love TF2 we have gathered our fair share of items.

Simply wearing these items costs a cosmetic slot and are not really that visible during gameplay, you could say that they are visible in a death-cam but in my eyes this is not really getting through and we all want to fill those precious and sweet cosmetic slots with items that you can really see. Now i am not saying we should change these items in such a way that you can no longer equip them. What i would like to see is that you can also (like in CSGO) decide what badge you want to have on your profile and deathcam. This way everyone can clearly see what kind of ""accomplishment"" you have achieved. Please discuss."

A lot of downtown is torn up right now, but hardly any of it is actually as a direct result of the LRT project. Rideau and queen st's will both have LRT stations but the surface work being done is not for LRT but rather water main replacements, the tunnel is much further down than that. Work along the Queensway will require years of lane closures on an already congested highway, and work on the transit way will result in buses being directed onto the Queensway and arterial roads."

I'd like to think the real OJ Mayo sits in his hotel room at night, during his usual NBA travels from city to city, and looks out his window across the cityscape and into the dark night and bright moon and knows how I truly feel about him. He sheds a single tear and looks down and whispers ""Thanks brandon"". Every player has an entourage or group of friends and guys that follow them around but if you Google ""oj mayo entourage"" you just get a bunch of pictures of him alone. Even one pic of him sitting in a hoodie holding a jar of mayonnaise like some sad joke. If you Google ""OJ Mayo girlfriend"" you get a suggestion to search for Mike Conley instead, just because they kinda look the same.

0,Crippling Hunter: 3 mana 4/2 battlecry: reduce a minions attack by 6,"I want to play some of the really cool cards I have like Thermaplugg, but I'm basically not allowed to use them if I want to win just because there's a 3 cost minion with reasonable stats (better than any 2 drop) that will completely remove that minion by itself, with no counterplay possible. The real problem is that it's neutral, because it's fine that Priest has things like Shadow Word: Death while everyone else has their own removal, but EVERY CLASS plays BGH which means there's never a ""good matchup"" for these big minions to see play in. It would be one thing if these minions sucked, but many of them are GOOD cards that simply can't see play because BGH exists, and that's terrible design. BGH often gives 7 or more mana worth of value without any setup or requiring the opponent to misplay, which is insane for a 3 drop. Blizzard creates problems and then tries to ""solve"" those problems with other problems, like buying a cat to kill mice and then buying a dog to scare away the cat, and then you end up getting something else to scare the dog away. The better solution would be to get rid of the mice yourself or learn to live with them. In Hearthstone's case, ""cheating out big minions like the giants"" are the Mice, ""BGH"" is the Cat, the flux of 6 attack minions is the ""Dog"", except this dog doesn't even get rid of the cat because the cat is still being used to keep the mice in check. There are a ton of ways to deal with things like the giants: Make a minion that can destroy any minion summoned for less than it's play cost, which counters Giants, Unstable Portal, and to a lesser degree Thaurissan. Make a minion that targets Giants (or even Giants and Dragons) specifically, and then give Giants a tribal tag. This is something they could put on BGH if they ""nerf"" it. Make a neutral minion that swaps attack with another minion, for example a 3/2 for 3. It's less effective at reducing attack than Peacekeeper, but it gains attack if it targets a big guy. Reduce the starting cost of some giants, but stop the price reduction early: This isn't a problem with cards like Mountain Giant which can't get near 0 anyway, but doing something like making Molten Giant stop reducing in price below 3 would also help fix the source problem. Give classes some more removal spells that target big targets. Shadow Word: Death is a good example. Just don't make the effect neutral because then things that are weak to it can suck in EVERY matchup. It's fine to run 2 attack minions even though Priest wrecks them and steals them, because those minions are fine against other matchups. This doesn't apply to minions with 7 or more attack, which are gimped at EVERY matchup because BGH exists. There are hundreds of easy solutions better than ""Have a neutral 3 drop with decent stats that can completely destroy any big minions""."

0,Why Do People Still Type Like This,"TIFU By Getting Angry At A Videogame And Getting Attacked By A Cat So I was playing a videogame after work today (the game is not important) and was annoyed. This is a common occurence for me, as I tend to use Videogames to relieve stress and I'm bad about shouting. My roomate doesn't like it, but who likes it even less, apparently is my roomate's cat. So as I'm playing the game, I'm doing unusually bad, and I get so mad that I throw the control down in a fit. The cat, who happened to be in the room at the time and apparently thought it's life was in danger, LAID INTO ME. HARD. I received scratches all over my right side, a cut across my cheek, and a big gash in my right ear. I am 100% at fault here, I don't hate the cat, shes my buddy even if she can be grumpy, but that attack is a wake up call. I'm going to be done with videogames that make me do that for a good long while. I'm tired of being angry and this pain is telling me its time to stop suffering the consequences. So the PS4 is going into my room until I can get a monitor for it, where I can be angry in relative peace without upsetting my roomate or his crazy cat.

0,Welcome to the Murtads legion of doom ;-),"Greetings and self introduction: New member Hey all! I'm a newbie to the reddit community and was glad to stumble onto this subreddit that I think will help me depressurize all what I've been bottling up for the past few years. I'm originally from North Africa, in my mid-20s, born to religious parents (though tolerant and progressive), who brought me up in KSA till was done with High School, then went to my country for college and now I'm here in the US. I was a true believer of Islam, convinced that it was making me a better person than I would have been without it. Even though I did have some minor issues, for instance, making friends with non-muslims; which I did have during school and college, but I still thought there is a reason behind it which I couldn't comprehend and that mindset of ""only God knows"" was pervading all my thoughts. When I went to college, I chose to be a religious person and pick my friends wisely to preclude any probability of ""blemishing"" my morality and becoming a habitual ""sinner"". I regularly read the Quran and other Islamic books for four years during my time in college to understand reasons and concepts, yet most of them seem so unnecessarily evasive, circuitous, and redundant with heavy reliance on non-existent evidence which eventually caused me to ""regress"" to a state of ""moral"" fatigue that I have yet to recover from till this day. I now self-identify as an agonist (first time attesting that). That is one burden lifted! Now I can move on to be a better person without the clutches of religion. However, not being to be true to myself in front of the people I genuinely care for is a shitty feeling that I might need to live with...don't like closing on a negative note but, oh well, lol. See you around and hope we get along well :)"

The exception is probably Martian Marines, who train to fight in Earth gravity for presumably extended stays (I'd love to find out how, maybe the MCRMC throws rookies on a barge full of gym equipment then blasts them out towards Pluto at 1G and turns back when they're Marines)."

Fortunately, they had moved offices by the time of the second earthquake (a 7.1, about five months later), which collapsed a wall into the break area, which would have crushed anyone eating lunch at the time (the earthquake happened at 12:51; wife's lunch break was 12:30-1:00). Although they did lose all paper records, as they had not removed them from the old building when they moved out (because leaving important records behind when you move out is a good idea, apparently)."

Is it just me, or does it seem like dating (in a city at least) comes with some sort of expectation of instantaneously sleeping together? I mean, I'll meet a friend of a friend (not even random bar meets, these are men my friends are friends with) we go on a couple dates, and by the second or third time we meet up, they want to have sex. I'm from a more-traditional area, and while I'm no prude, it was fairly common to wait until actually in a relationship to have sex where I was from. But now I'm in this huge city, and I just feel like everyone is out to get laid super fast. I want to find someone willing to date without sex until some kind of relationship/exclusivity commitment is made. Are my expectations for dating in the city unrealistic?

(other than EA doesn't wanna spend money on it) Matimio threw out a video today that touched on space battles in the original battlefield and it got me thinking; Im assuming most people who loved space battles played primarily against AI where, even if you were pretty bad at flying, you were probably leaps and bounds better than the AI. The new battlefront is going to be primarily online multiplayer. When you play against real people, they all aren't going to be shit. There'll be the select few who are absolutely insane at flying and they'll own space battles. Arguably that same thing applies in all game modes, but the gap between the average/best shooters is non-existant compared to the massive difference between the average/best pilots. I think DiCE are comparing space battles to air superiority from BF3/4 where no one plays it because the best pilots are literally the only one getting any points. They're afraid that people won't play it and putting that effort into the capital ships and balance for fighters will just go to waste."

Ferguson and Wenger are the guys that spring to mind but they're anomalies. Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Real Madrid have all stayed strong despite frequent managerial changes. Swansea are a great example at a lower level - they've been through goodness knows how many managers in recent years but they've had a consistent style and risen through the football pyramid to become a Premier League regular by this stage. If a club lacks a long-term footballing identity then they better hope they can find a coach that will stay the course or they'll end up like us in the 90s, or Sunderland now, with a nonsensical mish-mash of a squad that fits no one's footballing vision."

0,except we cant really tell people to step outside when they want to be fat.,"Is obesity this generations ""smoking"" ? I was talking to someone today and the conversation of smoking came up. I realized that only a generation ago everybody smoked. People in movies smoked, there were smoking ""role models"" and it was the ""cool thing"" to do. When the first reports of the dangers of smoking came out there were huge arguments from people that smoked. ""You can't tell me what to do with my body"" ""I'm not hurting anybody but myself"" etc..... Over time more and more of the medical issues were accepted as fact and slowly the number of people smoking went down although typically the changes were forced by forcing smokers to another room or more recently outside. The only problem is that as the next generations grew up they typically had the first 10-13 years of ""not smoking"" even if their parents did as an opportunity to break the cycle. With obesity kids of obese parents never have that chance so how do you break the cycle ?"

Hell, this might actually make wisp useful, if only to buff the combo. Possible Combo: Turn 9: flood the board with as many minions as possible, maybe use Onyxia for this.

You didn't shop around and price it out anywhere else so you want me to give you back your money so you can go buy it somewhere else so I can give you good customer service? I could hear her husband in the background telling her what to say.

0,i agree with you.,"This is a fairly common request, and it would be interesting, but how do you make it work from a gameplay perspective? Throughout the WoW expansions, you essentially quest through the new zones and more or less push the main threat back into dungeons/raids (and new content pieces like Quel'Danas, Isle of Thunder, etc). If we are to ""lose"", then how does that happen? Do we start losing as we quest through the Broken Isles? Do we lose every dungeon? That would be a little silly. If we succeed in all the dungeons, then is it the first raid that we start losing? People probably don't want to play multiple tiers of an expansion if they are just constantly thrown back, so is it the final raid of the expansion where we lose? That could work, but again, might feel like the entire expansion is pointless, which is a huge complaint about Warlords of Draenor's story. I'd also wonder if people would want to continue to farm a raid where, at the end, our armies are destroyed and the final boss wins. Again, I think it could be interesting but it would be incredibly hard to implement. I think instead we'll see us lose some battles (like the Broken Shore, where Varian and Thrall are rumoured to die), or even a whole patch (and then ""win"" in the last patch) but ultimately we'll win at least this part of the war."

0,M8 I was just going off what Google have as a definition fam,"They don't have to be functionless to be vestigial, even in biology. ""Vestigiality refers to genetically determined structures or attributes that have lost some or all of their ancestral function in a given species, but have been retained during the process of evolution."" Some *or* all. Definition in the Free Dictionary (the biological definition): Biology) (of certain organs or parts of organisms) having attained a simple structure and reduced size and function during the evolution of the species: the vestigial pelvic girdle of a snake. Simple structure and *reduced size and function*...reduced function, not absent function. Vestigial, even in biology, does not mean that *all* function has been eliminated, just some or the majority of it. The pelvic girdle in whales and other sea mammals have not lost *all* their function as you pointed out, but they have lost most of it, and therefore fall correctly under the term 'vestigial'. Just like the human tailbone and the appendix. They are vestigial but they also have not lost all their function. The appendix still, in most people, 'reboots' the gut with beneficial bacteria to help aid in digestion and the tailbone still serves as an anchor point and support for pelvic muscles and structures.

Not to mention a good chunk of the maps were all very similar with little variation. I imagine they COULD do a better space battle, but I'd rather them tackle what they feel they can do good instead of them try to do space battles and really not want to."

My thoughts for implementing it could be that it is entirely centered around mid-endgame and could be a combat elite skill that requires 70 prayer and constitution, that unlocks abilities like the other combat skills."

I actually believed that this could be pulled off to bring back atleast 3-4 lakh crore into the Government kitty. And it would also serve as a good warning for all those, including the political parties, hoarding black money in cash. But today, neither have happened and I have to eat my own words. Government was neither able to get back the black money. I am not sure what's the latest numbers on the deposits of old notes made but if the trend is to believed, we can as well say that this Demonetization has successfully proved that there is no black money in cash in the country! While we can all blame Modi for this, I think it's time we also question the RBI. This could not have been done without their approval/endorsement. They are the sole authority responsible for this. They should have strongly advised against this move and there is not even an iota of evidence that they even thought twice before agreeing to this move. While Modi would get his deal from the public when he faces the election(and rightly so), I think it's time RBI Governor steps down for the economic mess we are in."

But he kind of get obsessed with stats here, so let's look at the things he does really well. 1.) Setting the edge. He has a really quick first step and he did a great job at this at Louisville and a couple of times during the season. 2.) Coverage. In Davis' scheme, this is really important. The only major mess up was when he got burned by Antonio fricking Brown. 3.) Recognizing play action.

And I don't think you can say the Holy Spirit moved them when we have this culture of ""Gay = evil"" in the air around Christian America. We guilt gay people. We shame them. Is it any wonder people might be tempted to try being ""ex-gay?"" Without the Holy Spirit, even. It's un-Christlike to demand those who are hated, persecuted, and pushed to the edge of society live a more painful, difficult life than those who are considered ""normal"" and ""better"" by society. That is the polar opposite of how Jesus dealt with ""outsiders."" That should shed doubt on if God really *is* anti-gay; how often does God oppose the oppressed? And you cannot deny that humanity treats gay people worse than straight people. Approaching the Bible in any way except already having assumed the ""gay = evil"" conclusion will not lead you to the conclusion you've apparently reached."

1,Maybe he fought with Freeman in Black Mesa?,"Playing on a Half Life 2 RP server. It never had a large player group, being an Outlands server (where the combine will try to kill you), but back in the day it would have small groups on the weekends and the occasional new member. I was sitting around in one of the houses of the main village (its a night version of the section of the coast around New Little Odessa) when a new player comes on. He comes over to me and asks if there are any enemies around. Now, I try to stay in character by saying I had encountered a few zombies and there were always antlions on the coast - adding in a few jokes about them nearly ripping my leg off. Soon, he was running down to the shoreline, and there being little to do, the local rebel leaders (who are of course admins) go up to him and ask him in character what he's doing. He replies that he's going to go out and fight the zombies. Staying in character, we tell him its dangerous out on the coast. He then asks, in character, if the leaders are admins (considered a no no, since HL2RP is very strict on in character talk and character development, one of the reasons I went to it since it usually thins out the crowd of 12 year olds and other annoyances). They reply out of character yes, and being admins, spawn a few antlions to stage a little fight to show how you can't fight them with your fists (the default weapon for the weaponless). He proceeds to turn off the thumper near the gate and lets them in. When asked why later, he says he ""wanted to punch the antlions."" and again asks if he can go fight some zombies. Long story short, he becomes increasingly annoying (yet hilarious), asking for weapons, refusing to talk out of character about admins and servers, and despite us saying time and time again this is set well before the Uprising, repeatedly claims he fought with Gordon Freeman. Eventually, one of the admins gives me a pistol and permission to ""shoot the hell out of him."" I announce my intentions then proceed to shoot and punch him until he lures an antlion into the village and lets it attack me (Typing REVENGE and DIEEE!!!!!). Admin asks ""Should we kick him?"" I reply, ""Yes. Him and that damn antlion."" Of course, he repeatedly comes back (claiming he has hacks) and generally makes a mess until he gets banned for 8 hours. It was pretty funny to me, and I got a pistol out of it and an eventual 'promotion' into the Resistance, not to mention my okay RP looked fantastic compared to him, especially when I tried to make his work near the beginning."

I've seen a multitude of offers such as the Oilers' 4th overall pick plus something for the Av's 10th overall pick and Barrie's rights, but whether this is overvaluing/undervaluing draft picks or players, I'd like to see what Av's fans think."

Clinton was impeached over this. he gave a lawyer's answer to one question about if he had sex with Monica lewinsky under oath, he answers dishonestly but it wasn't technically a lie -- if you have ever heard ""it depends on what your definition of 'is' is"" it comes from this. Bill said that (or something close to if I misattributed some words or whatever). Which sounds stupid, but it was a very smart play. He definitely was dishonest, but the question was sloppy and allowed him an out. He answered the literal question. He was not, at that time, having sex with Monica lewinsky. Bill, as president, got a blow job in the Oval Office from a 24 year old intern (Monica Lewinsky, this isn't a theory, it's confirmed, She even had his DNA on a dress). Talk about a bad power dynamic. He also put a cigar in her pussy (consensual, unlike with the other gals). wether you believe these things or not, they're well established and very credible allegations. Bill Clinton could be a rapist, and Hillary Clinton may have intimidated her husband's victims to maintain her political power so she could one day be president. Not trump lies, it's real.

1,Because rent control has been so awesome in places that have it.,"The fields of Science are littered with the corpses of ""common sense"" ideas. UBI does not mean that there are more people or more houses. We already have a **massive** housing surplus... and yet prices have gone way up. And that's without any UBI at all. In other words, your assumption is too simplistic and is at odds with the empirical data about recent housing market behavior. Housing has been trending toward ""upscale"" properties for a long time even in the face of famously stagnant wages. You could just as easily say that low-end housing prices will either decrease or find a soft-cap since the lower end of the economy would be depending upon (read: *limited to*) their UBI... a landlord can put a sticker on his shithole, rat-infested apartment that says ""$100,000/yr"", but that doesn't mean he's going to get a tenant. It's far more likely that he's just waving around the price tag for the sake of marketing and fully intends to leave that unit empty while he decides what to do with it or until he can find someone who wants to buy that plot to demolish it to build a strip mall. Ultimately, the housing market must obey the supply and demand of its consumer base. Low end rents won't rise any higher than the lower end can afford (in which case... if they can afford it, what's the problem again?), and the upper middle segments will begin breaking even with the UBI in their taxes, so their housing won't increase either (because their net income won't change). And the upper end doesn't matter because their markets are not influenced by what millionaires *can afford*, they're governed by what millionaires *want to have*. But, again: *Who's to say that rent controls can't be put in place?* Especially considering how trivial they are to implement."

1,"play mustard yi, right clik 2 win gg","Because it's easy in theory. The entire game is very easy in theory. In a game, when you're watching every inch of the map, when you're running calculations like you're Deep Blue and IBM promised you a robot waifu for beating Kasparov, it's not always at the forefront of your mind. Knowing what to do and doing it are two entirely different things. There are so, so many variables in the game at any point in time it can be a subconscious stress to have an idea what's happening. So many possibilities, you get so caught up in focusing on certain factors that you can't take a mental step back and know what to do. Maybe in a world where you didn't have human opponents having the same thoughts as you, it would be easy. You have 5 enemies all thinking the same things you are, and being able to think circles around them is hard. Sure, just push mid as 5, or run a 1-3-1. Do you have the minions? What's to stop a solo pusher being collapsed upon? Do you know he'll run, when he's a 2/1 Darius? He'll try to 1v2. He thinks he can win. You think otherwise. Not easy. You and 4 other people have to think roughly the same way and faster than your opposing 5."

The downside is the fact that we only have two tracks, and I completely understand why that is. Outside of these events, TTK is almost the same as when it came out. King's Fall, weapon rebalances, and a few economy changes are the main differences. Other than that, Destiny is the same. I log on every Tuesday and do the same few strikes that are rebranded as the nightfall. Then after coordinating 6 people's schedules, we raid. We run that same raid every Tuesday. Three months later, and we're already tired of this raid and its double rng. I love the crucible. The crucible would love some new maps too. Weapon and class rebalancing is nice, but the last one brought us back to the Last Word's golden days. I hate and hated using that gun. All that rebalance did was just anger the community with their ""working as intended"" and ""0.4% buff"" to autos. My point is, if this is all I have to look forward to for the entirety of year two, then this is going to be a long year. And I thought year one was a long year. Note: I have tried moving on to other games, but I always find myself coming back to this game. I love this game so much, and every time I come back after leaving for a week, my heart sinks at the fact that nothing has change. My heart sinks even further when I realize that this will be year two in a nutshell. TL;DR: I just want some new content man, I can't play the same few things over and over without a new incentive or something that's actually new to play."

1,"Well, they did give the family a fruit basket...","I used to be the advocacy director for a very prominent regional animal welfare org; PeTA would drive me nuts. They have had some tremendous successes; specifically in their campaigns to get major fast food chains to adopt simply basic care standards for the chickens, cows, and pigs they use for their food. But their tactics made life difficult, often, for groups like us. Essentially they seemed to have a philosophy of ""if it shocks, and thus gains attention, it's good"". The problem is that a lot of people in the general public equate anything they see from PeTA with all animal groups; so whether or not PeTA intended it; We'd end up constantly explaining ""no we're not peta; no we didn't put up billboards just before MADD's spring break PR drive, telling college students to drink more beer because it's safer and healthier than milk"". I've never quite been sure why PeTA operates a local animal shelter; My community--with 25 years of strong spay/neuter laws--essentially euthanizes no healthy adoptable animals. but other parts of the country upwards of 90% of animals that come to them will have to be euthanized because of space. My take on this particular case is that the facts aren't too far out of the realm of what sadly happens at a lot of shelters; they are contacted by a local mobile home park with a stray dog problem. Meaning dogs that have no identifiable owners; living cruddy, dangerous lives, typically unaltered, etc. (in my area, there is really no such thing as a ""stray dog""... just lost dogs. But in other areas, there are LOTS of dogs living on their own; scraping by, maybe getting fed scraps by someone in the community). So they are given permission to go round up stray dogs--and say the little dog maya sitting on a porch and assumed she was stray too and took her. Now they fucked up in several ways; they did not ask residents to look at dogs; and they clearly did not put the dog on a required stray/hold (typically 7-10 days). The owner fucked up by not having a tag, a license, or a microchip, and not keeping their dog inside or in a secure fence. But honestly this is not too different than fuck ups that have happened shelters; not really a fuck up exclusive to PeTA. Where they DID fuck up is that absolute inability to respond to the press on this; they just avoided and avoided talking about it. For an org that employs at least 100 people specifically to get into the media; it's funny that they don't know the basics of damage control. Step one: acknowledge that the press is calling you and tell them you want to comment on the story and will at such and such time (like in an hour or two) so you can get all the facts together for the press Step two; assign one person to talk to the press; and tell the facts as best as you can. Under no circumstances lie. Explain that this should not have happened, you want to publicly extend an apology to the family and will also attempt to do so privately; and that your organization is going to address the causes of the situation and will absolutely share the results with the press when done. It's not Rocket Science; it's just hard when you are smugly ""always right"" to know what to do when someone points out you are wrong on something."

Most likely the use of force depends on where it is you are trying to make them leave. If it's a crime scene I'm guessing you tell them to leave. If they refuse then I'm sure they can be arrested.

Still worse, republican voters are rejecting establishment candidates. The GOP nears its end. The same is nearing for democrats with Sanders, but might still be an election or two away, especially if Elizabeth Warren is able to avoid monied interests for funding and does not answer to the establishment."

I don't mean to make a generalization, but it seems most of the men are looking for pictures of naked ladies and *super* hot Internet sex. If you're a male who can keep a decent conversation for longer than a week, message me. If you're a male who can *not* ask me for nude photos in their first message, message me. If you're a male with terrible jokes, definitely message me. I like bad jokes. Seriously. I like bad jokes."

1,Yeah because having your name on a planet and keeping things that actually affect your progression from others is totally fair.,"I disagree. I think that platform exclusives tend to annoy the platofrms that don't get them as opposed to making the receiving platform feel like special snowflakes. This includes the PC exclusive skins available through previous steam sales or partnerships with other websites and the PS4 obsidian skins Founders is a different matter, it was a *timed* offer that ended before consoles release, available only to early adopters before the game really took off. Without founders there would likely be no console versions. Platform exclusives don't make communities feel special, they serve to point out that not everyone is the same or equal, and that the platform you choose to play on makes a difference. All of that aside, a single cruddy skin isn't going to cause a big uproar, but it is one of those slippery slopes."

He began singing karaoke with a few of the bridesmaids and started to hug them. We had to ask him to leave because at this point he became irritable with the women for ""not being naked.""

I had a roommate when I was 19 who I found had left a bunch of needles hidden in the bathroom. I accused him of being a junkie and it turned out he was a type 2 diabetic and had to use insulin. He had hidden the needles so his son wouldn't get into them. I never knew he was diabetic because he was super private about it and only tested and injected in the bathroom or his bedroom so no one would have to see him do it. Most junkies won't leave too many clean needles around. If they have them they keep them, they will toss used ones which are pretty obvious from the residue in them. Tar stains needles a brownish gold color, but prescription pills won't leave a ton of residue behind like heroin does so they could always be banging oxycodone, morphine or hydromorphone. Just don't always assume needles = junkie since there's several legit medical reasons to have needles. A caveat is most people who need them for medical reasons usually don't overtly try to hide them, they'll keep them in the bag they come in or in a medication pouch that has binders to hold them. Most junkies hide them in glasses cases or socks or something they will fit inside but doesn't stand out like a sore thumb."

You can't really police that or have some non-stigmatized way to rescue the kid. It's not like CPS is a solid solution. So why not have a voluntary sterilization program? Lump sum of 20k to anyone who gets their tubes tied, plus subsidized education or something. Whatever amount is cheaper than the social cost of bad children. Make it enough money + benefit that dumb people who think they want kids but are easily swayed by money will take the deal. ie perennial junkie or crook who'd rather get cash. But not so attractive that people will do it just because they're in a hard-luck situation. It'd probably cost a bit at first - but in twenty years we'd also be able to cut a lot of child welfare programs and put them into other things instead."

1,"Yes, but then they would have to kill him/her because of ""character development""","Will Love Interests Ever Be Introduced For The Main Cast? One thing that has always kind of annoyed me as both a creative writer and a fan of this series is how there is no major love interests for anyone in the main cast. The closest we've come to this was Mia and Deigo's relationship, and Phoenix's past relationship with Dahlia Hawthorne. But no main character has ever had a major love interest. Edgeworth in the DLC case for SOJ said that he never plans on getting married himself, so he gets a pass. But I feel like it's about time for Phoenix or maybe even Apollo to have some sort of love interest. It could provide for some interesting story elements and cases. Why do you think the developers won't introduce any form of love interest for the main cast? Does anyone agree with me that giving Phoenix, Apollo, and/or Athena some sort of love interest would actually be interesting?"

So. It's time to fuck. It's time for SEX. You both take off your clothes. And you see the guy you like/lust/loljustmetonGrindr, in the full monty. And he looks good...until you see something about his naked form that turns you off. Now you're kinda grossed out. If not grossed out, you're turned off. Even if still turned on, you're disappointed and try to ignore that one small detail that you really don't like. You can't help it. You're not shallow (hopefully) but your body likes what it likes and it does not like what it does not like. For me? It's a number of things (I'm a picky bitch, deal with it...) If you have one of these things, don't be offended! Some guys may be into it or just don't care! 1) **Bad Feet** - I can't stand bad feet. I mean feet that have jacked up nails, cracked skin, some kind of rash, etc. It's just really turns me off. And if he has Lady Deathstrike toe-nails or toe fungus? I'm outta there. 2) **Carpet Ass** (a really hairy ass) - I don't mind a little peach fuzz. Really, it depends on the guy, the shape of his ass, and his hair color. White guys with blonde hair can get away with hairy asses since it's nearly invisible and very fine. But Indian/black/Asian guys with carpet ass? Nope. They look like they stapled road-kill to their glutes. It's especially gross if their body hairs is very coarse... 3) **Gorilla Back &amp; Satch** (really hair back and lower back) This is a big no-no for me. I really detest back hair of any sort. If I feel the back of your upper body and I'm clutching a carpet, my peen will retreat into my kidney for safety. It's even worse if a guy has a combo of gorilla back, satch and carpet ass....Chest hair can be great though! 4) **HBO** (Horrible Body Odor). A guy who smells like a mixture of sweat, cologne and soap is someone who smells really nice to me. He smells like a MAN. However if he smells like a mixture of rancid milk, day old feces and cheeseburgers, then I will be gagging. There's nothing worse than going down on the guy and coming back up for air because his junk smells like...junk. 5) **Duck Butter** Just google it and you'll see why.... What small physical details on a naked guy turn you off? *Be HONEST and don't take this too seriously (I.e. OMG, you're so shallow! This is what I HATE about the gay community rant rant rant...)*"

1,Lol qq git gud,"Star Citizen is Star Citizen and EVANGELIZING EVE as a model for Star Citizen is going to kill the game. I am for increased player interaction with the Star Citizen game world. Player should feel that they are having an impact on the world. As far as CIG's comments are concerned, this is what is intended to happen. However, we can't forget the fact that grinding is a part of any game. You will have to grind in Star Citizen to get the better ship and cooler stuff. Different ships will require different levels of grinding. You want a starfarer in game? You will have to grind to get it. Same goes for the other larger ships. You want the Orion? You will have to grind with the prospector first before getting it. People really seem to be going off on ED for its grinding aspects. Grinding is going to happen in Star Citizen as well. The difference will be that grinding will hopefully be made somewhat interesting. Your efforts might have an impact on the overall world. ______________________________ As soon as a thread became popular on the fact that ED was lacking content depth, people immediately started evangelizing EVE as the player activity and interaction model. EVE is in decline. It may pick up when a major battle occurs but otherwise it is an extremely toxic community that is leaking player who are no longer interested in playing the game because of its toxicity. Star Citizen is not EVE and it should not adopt EVE's broken player model. It gives players too much control. So you know what happens when they want to introduce new content? New methods of playing? New game mechanics? Change even the smallest thing? **MASSIVE BITCH FESTS. TOXICITY.** Because players do not want to lose their precious control over territories. Giving players overwhelming amount of controls means nothing changes. Having control becomes their reason to play and not because you are actually having fun. Anything that even borders on touching the precious control is deemed as game ending and people will hold massive walkouts and stop playing. This is why EVE is in decline. They can't change anything without massive bitch fests from all over the community and ultimately do not change anything. Star Citizen needs to avoid this outcome. So yeah lets have greater player control and impact over the world but not to the point that it becomes a detriment to introducing new content, new play methods. Where changing even the smallest thing about the world leads to massive backlash and threats to leave the game. CIG should not give up so much control that they can't even risk changing the game."

That way you can see a car in the rearview as they approach, then as they near the edges of it they're showing up in the side mirrors and as they get closer to out of its view they're already right next to you.

I've got a desktop box with 8 gigs of ram in it. Had to install the generic pae kernel to get it to work, and then went through some other crap to get the nvidia drivers to work. Anyway, it's pretty great, but I just don't feel like I'm using the system to its full potential. For instance, I'm using Mint and lxde, and the system just screams along, but I'd love to get it to boot into ram -- load the entire system into ram on startup, so all programs reside there, like the TORAM and boot2ram (or is it copy2ram) param on live CDs like Puppy. Unfortunately I haven't been able to coax this behavior out of the system. Also, Firefox is nice (I like fooling around with different browsers; just reinstalled Midori), but it doesn't like having tons of tabs open. Is there some way to make it take up even MORE ram? If it would help my browsing experience I'd like a way in about:config to grant FF an entire gigabyte, all to itself. Does this not seem reasonable? Obviously it goes against the core engineering idea of efficiency -- we'd all like to compress if we could -- but in this case I'd like to squander some ram."

Usually support forums such as this are mostly inhabited by those who currently need... support, and those who are doing well either just visit such a forum every so often or go on by in their remission-happy lives (which is a supremely great thing). Thus talk skews perception a bit in a negative direction. So it is extra good that if you happen to stumble upon here, to share what symptoms you had and what you have done to get into remission. I think maybe a monthly or bi-monthly thread like this could be a good idea."

1,bah fuck you and your logical arguments and knowledge of how the real world operates,"Someone somewhere is making piles of money off of everything you purchase. But your definition of piles isn't necessarily mine. The market sets prices for everything. Toyota makes piles of money. Same goes for GE, P&amp;G, Shell, Exon, DuPont, Apple, even Amazon. Simple logic: the new owner will probably clear $100-200 per door after everything settles at market and financing is set. So if this is a 9 unit building, that's $900-$1800/month. That's not a pile of money. There are a shit ton of expenses that people refuse to acknowledge with rentals. Property tax, insurance, maintenance, capitol expenses, property management, vacancy allowance, etc. Rule of thumb is that these should be about half of your monthly revenue. Then that other half needs to pay for your principal and interest payment. Whatever is left is your ""pile of money"". And for another thinker, if this property is as run down as they say, the new owner probably used private or hard money to get it under management and repositioned to be financeable with a traditional bank held mortgage. Meaning he could be paying 5-10% interest and literally making nothing until it's refinanced. It's a business. It was purchased based on market prices, otherwise it wouldn't have been sold. It is an asset that needs to make money. Unless you or someone else wants to subsidize it, the market will set the worth."

1,Nope devs aren't going to do anymore optimization..,"Devs, please continue to optimize ARK. The last few patches only made the game less enjoyable for me because of lousy framerates. Ok I will admit, I do not have the best computer. It isnt bad, it normally runs pretty smoothly in a lot of games. AMD 8350 4.2Ghz. 16Gb RAM, GTX670 w/2GB GDDR5. OS on SSD. Games on seperate SSD. Win7 x64 Pro. Yes it is long in the tooth, but not dead by a long shot. When ARK first came out I was playing 7 Days to Die and TOXIKK (which also uses the Unreal Engine). I heard that ARK was tough on the system but they were working on the optimization with every patch. Two weeks after ARK launched I saw it went on sale and I bought it. The game ran and I got about 15-20 FPS on medium settings. After a few optimization patches, I was getting 30FPS fairly solid with only a few dips... then... somewhere around patch 170 and the launch of Windows 10 &amp; new drivers for nVidia my FPS started to slowly decline. Mind you, I am playing solo on my computer, not on a server, so it isn't any lag from latency etc. AS of current patch I am getting 10-15FPS on my main save game. Also it takes 10 minutes to exit from the game to main menu while the game saves The Island. As a test I started a new solo game, with dino count set to 0. When I first started playing, all the same settings, I was getting 50FPS+++ I played for about 15 minutes and exited the game, less than 60 seconds to main menu. I reset the dino spawns to 1 (the default). Played for about 10 minutes and, now I am back to 10-15FPS again and the game still takes forever to exit to main menu. I realize we are still in alpha and that things are still being worked on, but if the game cannot play well on older hardware that worked before I feel that all the new dinos and playstyles/maps etc will be for nothing. I suggested one friend to get the game and his computer couldnt even get what mine could do. I have had other people ask me if I suggest the game and I tell them my issues and that they should wait til the game is more mature and optimized. When is the next round of optimization patches?"

Alice MacLachlan: ""For one thing, I'd think about some of the claims I'm making...perhaps, a productive use of your conversation in the protests is to rethink some of what you're saying."" On campuses, feminists are wearing the boot and they are using it to stomp out dissenting opinion, and you can see this through the arrogance of Alice MacLachlan's statements - she truly believes that she is absolutely right and anyone else must be wrong and therefore not allowed to speak as one of the ""consequences"" of protest. Imagine if she were in 1920s America and trying to make speeches about women's rights or the rights of racial minorities on campuses.

Misogynistic and homophobic, sick rhymnes and flow, but IT'S WRONG. Love Game? 2 of the best spitters ditching their usual styles to just kick it and have fun over a fast beat. But once again, it's crap because it has a few misogynistic lines. 3) Giving the ""deeper cut"" type of songs (Bad Guy, So Far, etc) simple two-word dismissals. So Far is ""middle aged finger waving"". WTF does that even mean? If you think a song is lackluster explain why. Write a sentence on it, what works, what doesn't, etc. Same thing with Bad Guy, if you think it's a sprawling epic, then explain why. 4) The author spends too much time talking about Eminem's entire catalogue and evolution. We know that Encore was weak/tired, Relapse felt forced, and Recovery had promise, but ultimately collapsed under its own cheesiness. These previous albums are irrelevant to MMLP2 - just like Illmatic doesn't make Nastradamus a top tier album, Recovery doesn't automatically make MMLP2 a weak album. Rather than reviewing MMLP2 in the context of Eminem, or even in the context of hip hop, try to review MMLP2 in the context of music. What was the quality of music like this year? How does MMLP2 rank amongst other albums we've had this fall? Is MMLP2 a uniquelly ""Eminem"" experience that other albums simply couldn't give? Should non hip hop fans check out the album because it has something very interesting about it? These are the questions a review should try to answer."

If the announcers explained that the heels were told these matches days ahead of time to train for them, then it would have some merit. However, that's not the case. You want to see an example on entitled millennials? WWE is creating a lot of them by saying to fans that being put in a one on one wrestling match by the heel group isn't fair.

1,Yeah that's why Israel's wall totally didn't work and didn't stop Hamas from sending suicide bombers into Israel or getting bomb supplies.,"It should be the most important issue for people who want to build a wall on the border. There is no way it will work unless drug profits are cut. The only way to do that is decriminalization or legalization. If a wall is built and it becomes harder for smugglers to cross, they'll raise prices to cover the extra cost of increased interdiction. They will end up making the same amount or more money off of this proposal. I'm going to be honest, this wall idea will do nothing to stop the flow of immigrants. The cartels are too well-funded and too sophisticated to let the border close. If anything, it will increase the violence along the border towns as the cartels compete for alternative routes into America. The smugglers will end up making more money if it's harder to smuggle people in. The reason why legalization hasn't happened in California is because everyone involved in the cannabis business is making ridiculous amounts of money off of prohibition; way more than they would if it was legal. Legalization in Colorado alone has dropped the price by half in my area, and I'm in Utah. The industry in California knows this and keeps it illegal. I'm not for state enforced borders, btw. I think people should realize what they're up against if they want to stop the flow of people. TL;DR, The border will never be closed unless the drug war ends."

1,They're an impressive team an all but they won't get to 100 points this season,"About that Blackhawks streak... In 2006, when the Ducks opened 12-0-4, three of those four were shootout losses, but one was an overtime loss. In 1985, when the Oilers opened 12-0-3, they obviously were simply awarded wins and losses for results even in overtime, and ties in lieu of today's shootout. So, under the 1985-86 scoring system, the Ducks' points streak would have ended after eight games. Isn't that a fairer way of comparing these streaks? The reason I'm bringing this up, of course, is that the Blackhawks 13-0-3 mark includes shootout losses only, meaning their streak would be valid even in 1985 (they also have two shootout wins, meaning if there were ties, they would be 11-0-5 right now). So don't the Blackhawks kind of already have the record to themselves? That's how I'm looking at it, anyway. Let's go Hawks."

1,I'm so happy for you.,"Just saw Alien and found it to be overrated. After seeing quite a few posts and comments on here mentioning how great this movie is I finally decided to try it. Let me firstly say that I didn't hate the movie but just didn't see it as a masterpiece. I generally stay away from movies which depict a group of people with one monster trying to kill them as there are so many and you tend to see the same old cliche scenes and endings (eg one survivor). So get your downvote buttons ready because here we go. The first thing that brought my piss to a boil or cliche number 1, was the uneventful first 20 minutes. If they cut it out and just started the movie from the scene where the crew descend on the planet it might have kept me awake enough to care what was happening. Not long after the movie starts (or should of started) we see one of the most retarded scenes in movie history. A dude, (presumably) discovers the first ever signs of alien life and what does he do? He takes zero precaution, alerts no one and then fucks with it. That's right. He fucks with an unknown life-form and surprise, surprise gets fucked with right back. Once the organism is inside the ship (we can accept them bringing it inside given the previous scene portrayed the crew member as having an IQ of a special needs student) the film actually starts getting ok and 50 minutes in i am actually curious instead of asleep or pissed off. The acid like substance from the alien and the medical state Kane is in are almost compelling. Next scene, next cliche. Dumb-ass, unimportant character is sent on a mission to find the cat (really? why the fuck would they even bring a cat?) and predictably dies. This an unnecessary, undeveloped character who adds nothing to the movie. Why did the company hire the most emotionally unstable woman they could find? At this point of the film you really have to question their hiring process. Does Lambert have any genuine role on the ship other than panic? Finally we near a conclusion and it's not bad as the rest of the movie, although the alien looks like a giant rubber toy when you see it hanging from the shuttle. Sorry in advance for all the hate this will probably cause. This is everything i hated about the movie after going in to it with high expectations. It is also possible that many of the cliches i found were actually cliche in more recent movies and this one was original at the time. To be fair I will add the things i liked: The effects were actually pretty good. The actors especially Sigourney Weaver did their parts well. Dude turning out to be a robot was a cool inclusion. I did actually feel suspense through some of the movie."

I went through labor, pushed her far enough to see her hair and then they decided she was NOT going to make it out that way and shoved her back inside me and rushed me down the hall for surgery. It took the first week to even get off the couch alone and almost a month to move normally. I didn't WANT a c-section but I'm thrilled I had one because I had ended up with a perfect baby girl."

1,there is no place for logical discussion here... Eli is trash and everyone knows it.,"See, people like you will look at the raw stats and come to a conclusion and think you made a valid, educated assumption. Eli isn't just consistent, he's possibly 1 of the most consistent Quarterbacks in the league. It's not *""either he's the best or the worst!""*. It annoys me when people say that. Whether he's throwing a forced interception or an 80 yard bomb for a TD he is the same QB with the same mindset, the same skills, and the same confidence. When he begins a drive you have no idea whether he throw a pick six or a 50 yard touchdown the previous drive. Not many quarterbacks are able to do that. He's one of the few quarterbacks that possess that skill, and something that would help out tremendously any QB. Look at the 49ers game for an example this year. Eli threw 5 INTs in the same game. Some of them were his fault, a couple were just bad luck. Yet, not a single one of them effected his mindset or confidence the following drive. That's because once he starts to become afraid of making mistakes or making the same throws then he knows it's all over. Many young QBs will make a throw, it ends bad, and never make the throw again. This leads to failure. Look at EJ Manuel in Buffalo, dude plays scared every play and that has lead to his demise. 2013 was a disaster year for him because he was surrounded by a godawful offensive line, playing in the least QB friendly and outdated offensive system in the league while throwing to players running the wrong route for 16 games. He wasn't afraid of making a mistake because he knew he had to make plays for the team to stand any chance of winning. Unfortunately, it didn't work out because no one else was making plays. 2013 Eli is no different from 2014 Eli. He was just surrounded by a capable pass-blocking offensive line, a much much better and modern offensive scheme with McAdoo, and players who started making plays in 2014. People don't take into account that Eli played in a turnover-pro offense for his entire career before 2014. Gilbride's entire offense scheme relied on each and every player needing to be in sync on each and every play. While it works great if you have the right players, more often than not it will lead to a turnover. You can look at the Eli's # of interceptions all you want and make your own assumption, but the fact is there is much more to it than just that."

A note about Illidan though: His unique effect allowed the Hearthstone Science channel to show how it's possible to have your freshly played minion stolen by Sylvanas before the Battlecry, in which case the Battlecry triggers for your opponent. The chain of command was that you play the minion, which triggers Illidan BEFORE the Battlecry phase, which triggers Knife Juggler again still before the Battlecry, which can result in Sylvanas stealing the newly played minion. Then your opponent gets the battlecry, which could have very unusual results (Doomguard: Opponent discards 2 cards)."

1,Garden Warfare 2 is a shooter.,"Looking at a new MMO - FFXIV vs. GW2 So I've finally broken free of WoW (and Blizzard as a whole) and I've been looking at other MMOs; specifically FFXIV: ARR and Guild Wars 2, as they're currently the two biggest (that aren't also ass - looking at you ESO and SWTOR). I'm familiar with GW2 some as I played the SHIT out of GW1 and I played GW2 until just before Heart of Thorns launched. I liked it, but got sucked back into WoW unfortunately. FFXIV has always looked interesting since the reboot, but I heard it didn't get good until Heavensward came out, and that it takes a really long time to get going. FFXIV just had a content patch in Sept., while Season 3 of GW2's Living World is currently going on. I kind of like GW2's new more action-orientated combat, but something about the classic trinity and gameplay in something like FF is really appealing too. NOTE: The subscription fee isn't an issue in FFXIV for me."

1,"hm so you had cake and cupcakes and feel terrible...yup carbs are definitely the devil, and you feeling terrible robably had nothing to do with eating pure junk food.","Binged on carbs today, never again. I feel like I'm going to explode. So I've been on keto really successfully for a few weeks or so. Today, I just moved to a new place for the summer and I went to a BBQ with my host family. I made a cake and cupcakes earlier and had a little frosting here and there, definitely cheating (only had eggs for breakfast and a salad for lunch), but I figured it would be alright to maybe ease off for a day because I'd been doing so well and wouldn't mind restarting keto from scratch the next day. BOY WAS I WRONG. I didn't think about this until too late. But if it takes adjusting to get rid of carbs, it will be damn hard to get your body to start adjusting to them. Keto flu was pretty bad. But this is like lactose intolerance times a billion (I am lactose intolerant, and for those not familiar, it's just gas and stomach/lower abdomen pain for hours). I had a piece of the cake that I made and some garlic bread and I am regretting it more than anything else. So right now, I'm typing this laying on my bed as horizontal as possible, really upset that I didn't think about this beforehand, and farting up a storm (sorry for TMI). But this is awful. Lesson learned. My body totally adjusted to a good clean keto diet, barely any carbs, and today it was like wtf is this stuff? I can't wait to get back into keto. I'm such an idiot. NEVER AGAIN. tl;dr: carbs during keto, even for a small break, is a big NONO, unless you like being uncomfortable and smelly."

1,Dair and MAYBE Bair.,"Key Fundamentals to Learn on Falco SSBM? So I am picking up Melee again, having played it early on release and barely touched it in nearly a decade. To cut a long and boring story short, I've been playing a lot of Smash 4 - but I really do want to pick up Melee as well. Smash 4 is very welcoming in terms of the technical mechanics you need to learn as a fundamental level to be ""competitive"" - by that I do mean just expressing a desire to learn and improve in a more aggressive manner (opposed to passively improve) - when I look at SSBM I love that there is so much technical depth to it, but I am a little bit lost as to what to FOCUS on while learning. Where do I start, what should I be doing, should I let somethings come naturally, so on and so forth. I am pretty aware of things like short hop ff lasers specific for falco, or more general things like wave dashing (which I still cant do consistently!) and so on. What advice would you give to someone wanting to pick up Falco, has a basic understanding of the game in theory but not execution, to focus on. So for example; 1. Work on this 2. Need to know this before you do anything else 3. this is a key basic combo 4. etc I am sure many of you can appreciate trying to learn a game with such a deep wealth of knowledge due to its longevity. Once I know what basics I need to get down I am normally pretty good at picking up from there (I do have a background in competitive games)"

When you lower your calorie intake your body goes into some kind of ""efficiency mode"" that means the body learns how to operate with a low intake. The other thing the body learns is that it needs to immediatly ""store"" energy (fat) once it's available. Thats why most diets have a rebound effect. If you really want to lose weight you have to gain muscles. (not bodybuilding, just normal fitness) The more muscles your body has the higher your calorie usage is. Even when idle or doing office work. Do not cut your meals! Be sure to have a propper and balanced intake. Don't skip breakfast (as mentioned before - ""efficiency mode"") Less alcohol. More sport. This is a longterm thing, don't expect to lose a ton of weight in a few weeks (muscles are heavier than fat) Agressive dieting damages your body, I hope you can motivate yourself to do more sports and think about what I've written here. The best of luck!"

1,Stephen Hill 2015.,"Some thoughts, for those that complain about signings... I remember when people cried about us signing Mike Mitchell a couple years ago, because he ""sucked"" with the Raiders. Mike Remmers was made fun of by Panthers beat writers and most fans ignored the signing. Dwan Edwards was a bust in Baltimore and played a couple poor years in Buffalo. He's been a solid role player on our team for years since signing in 2012. Ted Ginn was a bust as well, being a good return man and nothing else everywhere else he's been.. but he sure was a key piece of our 12-4 season two years back. Here's a name for you, Evan Mathis. Remember when he was a subpar guard on our team? Yeah, he's been one of the highest grade offensive linemen in the NFL for years in Philly. Sometimes a new home, new scheme, new coaches, make a difference. Sometimes they don't. In any case, competition and depth are good things. Let's remember that there are people paid a ton of money to evaluate these guys, and at least in the Gettleman years so far, they've done a pretty good job at identifying diamonds in the rough."

He was clearly well informed about Clinton's ideas about gays and smart enough to see her acceptance was nothing more than a political move, but him and his partner make a good amount of money. Money they're afraid Bernie wants to tax them on. Conversations with other NY voters, young and old, various races, all had the same sequence. They believe a lie about Sanders, they address Clinton's undeniable corruption and acquiesce, and finally land on not wanting to be taxed. ""Well, Bernie's Vermont guns caused Sandy Hook and all other NY gun crimes. Sure she's got a few things to answer for, but so do all politicians so what's the big deal? If Sanders is elected and taxes me how he wants, then it won't even be worth it for me to work anymore."" Clinton is a conscience friendly Republican vote."

Religious claims fall into the latter.

""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" Yes, I know people will start harping about the ""well regulated"" part, but the key is the ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed"". For this not to be the case, instead of ""being necessary"", it would be ""is necessary"". It's *accompanying* the main point of the Second Amendment, which is that people have the right to defend themselves. Also, governments can get up to mischief against their own citizens. It's happened in Germany, the USSR, China, Iraq, and other places. What's to think that it won't happen in the USA? Because we have democracy?

I had a really fun art teacher and we always used to joke around and a lot of the time our jokes took a turn for the dark side. One time we were doing this project where you had to build a sculpture out of household items and one of the options was wire coat hangers. Someone said that they needed coat hangers and my art teacher came over and asked me to go get some out of this other room. I was like ""Yeah sure"" and she handed me her keys and told me to go to this one room down the hall. I walked down the hall, then opened the door and looked at the guy who was teaching the class. I asked for coat hangers. Then, suddenly it hit me that everyone in the room were pregnant teenage girls or teenage girls with young children on their laps. My school was a charter school that the schools in the area sent all the pregnant students to so that they could do their schooling and have all their extra needs tended too. The teacher looked at me right in the eyes and said ""Get out"" really sternly. I awkwardly walked back into my class. I thought I had been the one who screwed up and went to the wrong room until I saw my art teacher with a giant grin on her face when I walked into the room. I went over to her and she started laughing and told me that they're actually in another room. The rest of the year the teacher in the mother's class always gave me dirty looks when I saw him."

We don't want children. I could list the hundreds of reasons why, but I think you all have a general idea already. My wiser, older 30-year-old friend informed me last night that, at my current age, I don't know what I want because my brain isn't fully developed. She said it's a very good thing the doctor convinced me to get an IUD instead of a tubal ligation because I WILL want children in five years. In fact, because I've denied this truth for so long, when my hormones finally reach their final form, I'll probably overcompensate by having five to ten children. She even provided supporting evidence by explaining why she didn't want children at my age, but now, after witnessing so many others having children and finally having a fully functioning brain, she has seen the light. This was horrifying news, but I now I know that eventually I'll consider it exciting news! And more importantly, I can start accepting the death of my goals and dreams now before my ten future children crush them. I felt obligated to share this epiphany with all of you before you destroy your potentially meaningful, children-filled futures by hastily mutilating your reproductive organs.

Hobby Lobby doesn't want to pay for their employees' contraceptive coverage, right? The argument being put forth by their lawyer (heard it this morning on NPR) is that the employees are free to buy contraceptives on their own, but it would be wrong to ""force"" the company to provide contraceptive coverage as part of their health plan. Well if the employees go out and take the money they earned from working at Hobby Lobby to buy contraceptives or even pay for an abortion, isn't that the same thing? Health insurance is part of the compensation earned by employees. So if Hobby Lobby pays X amount of dollars per month for a health plan which provides contraceptives, or the employee spends X amount of their wages on the same product...what's the difference? Either way Hobby Lobby's money is going to pay for something contrary to the religious beliefs of the owners."

Things like; we need to be perfect in our worthiness, we need to have faith, we need to fast etc. I then raised my hand and said that it can't be that simple because it is common for the 12 and other top leaders to reply to people asking them for blessings that their home teacher or possibly some other local priesthood holder should give the blessing (I'm sure there is some Ensign or conference talk on this). I then told them that leaders must not believe that their blessings are any better than a typical member's otherwise that would mean they don't really care about the sick. I told them that, to me, this indicates that we way over-stress the importance of worthiness and that the Lord would bless them regardless of worthiness. Totally derailed the lesson and I just sat back and smiled. Note: I believe this indicates that the brethren know that their blessings aren't any better. If they really had that power, they would be giving blessings 24/7, at least if they are true servants of God. THEY DON'T BELIVE WHAT THEY PREACH"

1,Be sure to leave out the main game winning aspect so that you can win on their first playthrough.,"I need your advice: Explaining Rules I have a problem. I'm the main board games enthusiast in my little casual board gaming group. The others seem to get a real kick out of games but there's one thing that lets us down whenever we try new games... I'm just no good at explaining the rules. If I go through every rule in detail right at the start, I notice I lose people as they get impatient and think 'let's just play and see how it goes'. Then if I just get started before explaining every rule and introduce them only when they become relevant, it sounds as if I'm making it up as I go along. Now I know it's difficult to give general advice, but do you guys have any tips on explaining rules to casual gamers? It's a really important part of making the game fun for people and I could do with some advice! If it's relevant, the games we play (or have played) are: Citadels, 7 Wonders, Settlers, Carc, Dixit, San Juan (the Puerto Rico card game). Pretty standard gateway stuff.

He aggressively approached the officer then stopped. What does all this mean? By being in shape, he is physically intimidating the officer. By approaching the officer, he is intimidating the officer. By stopping (this is very important), he is trying to draw the officer in to attack him by tricking the officer into thinking that he's not going to attack by stopping (a trick the elderly man learned from ""Charlie"" in Vietnam) The man is probably a trained combat veteran and could easily kill the officer with his bare hands using other tricks he learned from ""Charlie"" in Vietnam.

Plus, the officer is fat and very out of shape and couldn't handle this elderly in-shape highly trained killing machine. The officer was definitely in the right here. s/"

1,ya I would much rather get killed by faster firing weapons from farther away.,"With the recent communication about Shotguns from Bungie, here's my two cents. Make range and impact correlate inversely rather than directly. The only Shotguns worth a damn in PvP at the moment are the Matador 64, Party Crasher, and the old Conspiracy Theory. They all fall among the highest impact Shotguns in the game, as well as the ones with the longest base range. This is a problem, as they are the most likely to one shot kill due to their impact, and can do it at the longest range. This makes Shotguns as a whole seem too powerful, and leaves no place for low or medium impact Shotguns. If any of you play Battlefield 1, Dice is experiencing a similar problem, as the Model 10-A Shotgun has the highest damage and range, which leaves no room for its lower damage and faster firing counterparts. (How many times has the 10-A killed you vs the M97 or 12G Auto?) But how do you fix this specifically in Destiny? You make it so that having higher impact leads to a lower base range. If you want the more consistent one shot kill, you'll need to risk a bit more and get closer. If you want a relatively safe distance from just being punched to death, use the faster firing ones and risk needing a follow up shot or melee. This would also pave the way for the Chaperone to potentially have a role, as it is also currently overshadowed by the M64/PC+1. Now the reason that Dice hasn't done this is that Battlefield is a semi-realistic game, set in the real world, where more powerful weapons *do* tend to have more effective range. Bungie, in their sci-fi/fantasy setting, has the luxury of making tweaks like this. The biggest implications of this would be that in PvP, a low impact Shotgun shot followed by a long range melee (specifically Thunderstrike, and, to a lesser extent, Blink Strike) may be a bit too powerful. Right now, high impact Shotguns aren't the most consistent, and would need a slight damage boost to allow them to *reliably* OHK at said point blank ranges. In PvE, high impact Shotguns are already below low impact ones, and a range nerf wouldn't help, so they could serve to get a damage boost there as well. (As well as smaller boosts for all Shotguns in PvE because they're kinda lackluster IMO) Thoughts?"

1,"The more armor the unit has, the higher the defense.","How exactly does Defense work? With the new units having leader skills such as ""Ignore units Defense"" and new items that do the same (Demon Lance), I feel like it's important to visit this topic as it doesn't seem to exist yet. Note: I'm not looking for speculation or guesses, more testing or research. An official answer from Gumi would be nice but that likely won't happen. So the easiest way to approach this is relative to Attack. It's pretty easy that each point in Attack increases your damage by 1. Simple. The first question would be how does defense reduce damage? Is it percentage based? Flat number based? Some sort of hybrid between the two? If I have one unit with 700 defense and one with 1400, and they both were attacked for a 1000 base damage attack, what would the resulting damage taken be? I remember seeing recently when fighting a Bat Mimic that my Lock with 1700 defense took ~450 damage and my Zeln with 750 defense took ~950 damage. So by going from 750 to 1700 defense it seems I almost reduced the damage by half. However, I don't think this is how it works. In another scenario I'd get hit by a weak AOE and half of my units would take 1 dmg per tick and one of my weaker units took 43 dmg per tick. I'm pretty sure the difference in defense didn't reduce the damage taken by 99%. Basically to ever take 1 damage means there is a flat number reduction somewhere in the calculation. One of the reasons this is important now is choosing a leader. At what point does by-passing defense result in more damage taken than increasing damage by 50%. The answer percentage wise is 33%. To get this, if a unit does 1000 base damage and the leader skill was ignoing defense, then you'd always do 1000 damage. If the leader skill was to up damage by 50% then you'd do 1500 damage, but that'd be reduced by 33% so the resulting damage would be 1000. As we don't know how defense really works, it's hard to see where the defense integer results in the ""33%"" answer. Also this is ignoring that the leader skills and items are ""Chance to ignore..."" as opposed to always ignore. Any light on this subject would probably help the community moving forward with choosing unit line ups. Tl;dr How does defense work exactly."

1,Well said but there is no way that I am upvoting your comment for fear of repercussions.,"Every 6 months or so there is a ""what is the dirtiest joke you know thread"" on reddit. Some of them may be funny. If you find any of them funny, I should apparently call your employer and the police so that you may be separated from society and at the very least prevented from doing any work with people. It would be bad enough if it stopped there, but if you support any insulting cartoons, your rights as citizens should be questioned because you are supporting hate speech. That includes cartoons insulting your ""fairly elected"" rulers. So, hitting like/upvote on a joke should get you banned from society, if that joke insults anyone.... or we could insist that those participating in witch hunts against joke upvoters be banned from society?"

But there is no discussion about it because it doesn't serve the consciousness of the range of personalities you've been possessed by. I don't know how else to explain.

RDA really fucked up the whole schedule. If Mcgregor get scheduled to fight next against Edgar, then RDA will have to get scheduled to defend his belt against someone else aswell.

1,And of course calling corporate fixes everything,"""Well He's old, you know how they can be"" So I work at a gas station. The location I'm in has it's fair share of less than polite people for some reason and I have plenty of stories to tell about it. Today I'll tell you one that happened around a month ago that got me a bit miffed. So I'm in the back, cleaning up the kitchen area when I hear one of my co-workers yelling for me. I come out, see a man looking disgruntled in her line and asked what the problem was. He says his card isn't working on the pump and he wants to get gas. Ok, no problem, I tell him I can run his card in here I just need to know how much gas he wants. Time for dialogue! OG = Old guy OG - ""What! I want to fill up!"" Me - ""Ok, well you can overestimate a bit. It will only charge you for what you pump in the end but to start it off I'll need to set an amount. OG - ""I just need to fill up! Can't you people help me! Me - ""Yes sir, like I said I can run your card in here or if you'd like I can come out and see if I can help get the pump to read your card."" OG - ""To hell with all of you! Bunch of useless kids don't how to do anything! All I want to do is fill up! Just start the pump for me! He begins to leave but I before he's out the door I yell Me - ""Sir I can't turn the pump on without payment first. We are a pre-pay station. OG - ""You bunch of idiots! Go to hell, all of you!"" He walks out and I hop on a register to help with the line that formed behind him. I get a customer that is laughing and telling me he can't believe some people. A lady enters my coworker's line and is loudly saying ""Can't anyone help him?"" My coworker kinda ignores her and finishes checking her out. She leaves, then comes back in up to me. AL = Annoying Lady AL - ""Is there a manager here I can speak with?"" Me- ""Yeah that's me."" AL - ""Unbelievable, how could you treat that poor man that way? All he wanted to do was get gas."" Me - ""I know, I tried to help him. I told him all the options and offered to come out myself and help."" AL - ""No you didn't I was standing right here and heard everything."" Me - ""Did you hear the part when he called us idiots and told us to go to hell?"" AL - ""Well he's old, you know how they can be. Just come out here and help him."" I say fine and head out the door towards the pump he was at. I get there and she follows. I ask for his card, he gives it to me and I slide it in the card slot. Everything works fine, I think he was putting it in upside down. Me - ""Looks like you're good to go now."" OG - ""Finally, thank god there's people like this lady here."" AL - ""I called corporate and reported what happened. There's no reason you should have been treated so badly."" Me - ""Ok, well have a good night then."" I walk back inside scratching my head. Fun times."

It didn't help, though, that so much of the hublub centered around Quinn, who, while certainly not the most upstanding individual, has absolutely no power over the kind of thing that GamerGaters claim that they want changed.

This may come as a shock to some of you, but if the server resets in 1.9, **I'm not re-founding Cradle**. This is to try and fix the inactivity decline. I think it's the sense of obligation to work on projects that has made me inactive. Without Cradle, that sense of obligation will not be there, or will be much smaller. Cradle will be manifested in a way on the new map, in the form of Cradle Farms. Cradle Farms will be my attempt to create a new Samin Farms. For those of you who don't know what Samin Farms is, it is a large farming complex on the south line of the nether hub. Cradle Farms will be a public farming complex with one rule: if you harvest, re-plant. However, Cradle Farms will not be founded immediately. Before the farms are founded, I will be helping out to get some more of the infrastructure of the server set up, such as a new End farm or iron farm. These projects I deem to be more important, and therefore will be worked on before Cradle Farms is founded. I hope everyone is in understanding of this decision with me. -Jpmac11 ~TheCrazyCyborg"

Team had played well before...if Randall and DMC could be ok, and if our defense could be just as good as it was (not very good) then there was no reason to think we wouldn't be a pretty damn good team with a nice shot to do well in the playoffs! I remember posting on here, that NOTHING matters if Romo goes down. Well low and behold, Romo goes down and our team falls apart and we have the worst season in recent memory. Our defense was about as crappy as we felt it would be, our running game was pretty damn good as we hoped it would be. So w hy did we suck so hard? We can't close out teams, and even in 2014, we haven't been able to close out a team with our defense for damn near as long as I can remember. In 2014, Romo got us leads and Demarco closed them out. And if that didn't happen, we could always count on Romo to bring us back and give us a chance for that FG or game winning TD IF we got the last possesion. Please note that's our offense: getting us leads closing out games and/or bringing us back from the brink. Our defense rarely ever makes game changing plays when we need them. Because this teams defense SUCKS DICKS at closing out games when we have a lead. I had a feeling that every time we are up by less than 8, and the opponent gets the ball in a situation where they will have the last possession, we're done. We cant' get any pressure on the QB, and in no huddle 2 minute drill it's just way to much pressure on our extremely below average defense to hold onto that lead. We saw it last year in OT 2 times. Neither time did the offense even get on the field and we lost. Reddit and PFF to the rescue here is the data since 2011 in the scenario where the Cowboys are either tied or ahead by less than 8 with 4 minutes to go in the 4th quarter. Dallas has allowed the most TDs in that time with 12. The Vikings have allowed the most total scoring plays with 21 Dallas has lost more games than any other team in the league in this scenario with 15 losses since 2011. That's out of 31 opportunities, which is 48.39% of the time. That's almost a full season worth of losses because our defense can't stop the opponent when it matters most. and in that time, Dallas has the worst percentage of all NFL teams. So with all that being said, looking at our current roster, what reasons do I have to believe our defense is better now at getting press ure and sealing wins. With Romo, there are games we'll win even though the defense gives up points at the end of games as long as there is SOME time left for him to use his magic. But if he goes down, and he probably will at some point, we're doomed. I do believe if we have Romo, and Elliot playing well that we can close out games using our offense, but that's such a damn risky proposition. Because your a one trick pony at that point, and if that pony gets hurt in any significant way, again, we're doomed. ..discuss"

1,old champ old kit deal with it and main somebody with real mechanics,"Blitzcrank Ultimate passive doesn't make sense Hi, I'm a veteran Blitzcrank main with 550k mastery points currently in plat 3. During my 4 years of maining blitz I've continuously asked myself why Riot hasn't reworked Blitzcrank's ultimate. As blitzcrank currently is now, there is no place for him except in the support role, but blitzcrank's ultimate passive has no place in a duo lane as it simply disrupts the ADC's farm. And don't get me started on warding the jungle. Being unable to turn off the passive makes me take huge amounts of damage from monsters I have no business fighting. The silence I really value as a support, but it's way to short (0.5sec) to be used as anything but a disruption. I don't mind blitzcrank being an agressive support with extra damage, in fact that's why I fell in love with him, but the damage passive is just stupid and has no place on a support. What I propose is either an ultimate rework in it's entirety or at least get rid of the god forsaken passive and instead make the silence last longer, either for each individual level, or as a constant."

1,She obviously realised you didn't shower in between asking her to come to have lunch with you!,"One More Rejection There's a woman at my job that I found to be attractive and whenever we see each other we tended to have pleasant enough conversations. Therefore, I figured why not go ahead and ask her to hang out outside of the confinement of the job. Start easy and friendly with getting lunch together. So when I asked her today if she wanted to go and get lunch together sometime when we went at the same time what was her response? ""Sure Realistic0ptimist we can get lunch together!"" or ""Maybe, it depends on what I feel like eating."" or even a ""No, I like my lunch time to myself."" instead she looked at me in puzzlement and asked me ""Why would I want to do that?"" I wasn't aware there was a 0% probability that one could conceive a reason to go out and grab lunch with a coworker even if the feelings are just platonic. It's times like these I wonder why I even try."

But, if you pose that same question to Albertans, they go: Man, that Notley is really going to screw us up!"
1,"Well, it's good that we have an inexhaustible supply of natural resources then, right?","People treat this as if it is a bad thing. The essence of a capitalistic economy is that it is continually progressing. People become able to meet more and more desires over time. They never ""run out"" of desires and sit placidly doing nothing. Human life and happiness consist in continually setting and meeting new goals. No one (except maybe 1 1/2 monks somewhere) is satisfied simply by living in a shack with bread and water. The major difference between a capitalistic economy and a pre-capitalistic or anti-capitalistic economy is that continuous economic progress is possible under capitalism but not under other systems. In previous centuries, the population would rise to a certain level, then livings standards would become worse and worse until enough people died to bring the population back into balance. Under capitalism, there is no limit to the amount of wealth that can be produced and consumed. Human progress continues indefinitely. However, huge numbers of people (usually of the religious or socialist type) continually damn capitalism for this and bring up all these specious arguments about ""keeping up with the Joneses"". The implication is that, if the demonic Jones family did not exist, people would not want all these extra goods, and we would be able to fulfill all of everyone's desires in a ""sustainable"" fashion. But while well-adjusted person does not measure his self-worth by comparison with others, that by no means implies that it is not desirable for that person to continue increasing his standard of living as much as possible. A rational person does not regard the fact that, after acquiring a car, he now wants a faster car or a boat as a sign that it is pointless to try to fulfill any of his desires since they will never *all* be fulfilled. (Although that has certainly been an influential position: see Buddhism.) Rather, he takes pleasure in continuing to fulfill new desires as they arise. It is progress, not stasis (or attempted self-annihilation) that is the foundation of human happiness."
